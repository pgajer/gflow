/**
 * @brief Extend the complex by one dimension, preserving all existing structure
 *
 * @details
 * Appends a new chain degree to the discrete chain complex, incrementing pmax
 * by one and initializing all data structures for the new dimension. This
 * operation preserves all existing metric structures, boundary operators, and
 * Laplacians at lower dimensions. The function is designed for incremental
 * complex construction where simplices are built dimension by dimension.
 *
 * MOTIVATION:
 * During nerve complex construction from k-NN neighborhoods, we discover
 * simplices dimension by dimension: first vertices, then edges (by checking
 * pairwise neighborhood intersections), then triangles (by checking triple
 * intersections), and so forth. Each dimension depends on having the previous
 * dimension fully constructed to check face existence. This function enables
 * that incremental workflow without destroying lower-dimensional data.
 *
 * OPERATION:
 * Let p_new = pmax + 1 denote the new dimension being added. The function:
 *
 * 1. Increments pmax to p_new
 * 2. Resizes all dimension-indexed containers to accommodate p_new:
 *    - g.M (metric diagonal and matrices)
 *    - g.M_solver (Cholesky factorizations, if maintained)
 *    - L.B (boundary operators)
 *    - L.L (Hodge Laplacians)
 *
 * 3. Initializes the new dimension p_new with default values:
 *    - g.M[p_new]: Sparse diagonal matrix with ones on diagonal
 *    - g.M_solver[p_new]: Null pointer (no factorization yet)
 *    - L.B[p_new]: Empty boundary operator matrix (shape: n_{p-1} × n_new)
 *    - L.L[p_new]: Empty Laplacian (to be assembled after boundary operator is built)
 *
 * USAGE PATTERN:
 * The typical usage in complex construction is:
 *
 * @code
 * // Start with vertices only (dimension 0)
 * riem_dcx_t dcx;
 * dcx.pmax = 0;
 * dcx.vertex_cofaces.resize(n_vertices);
 * // ... populate vertex_cofaces with self-loops and edges ...
 *
 * // Add edge dimension
 * dcx.extend_by_one_dim(n_edges);  // Now pmax = 1
 * dcx.edge_registry.resize(n_edges);
 * // ... populate edge_registry ...
 * dcx.build_boundary_operator_from_edges();
 *
 * // Add triangle dimension
 * dcx.extend_by_one_dim(n_triangles);  // Now pmax = 2
 * dcx.edge_cofaces.resize(n_edges);
 * // ... populate edge_cofaces with triangles ...
 * dcx.build_boundary_operator_from_triangles();
 *
 * // Compute all Laplacians
 * dcx.assemble_operators();
 * @endcode
 *
 * METRIC INITIALIZATION:
 * The new dimension starts with identity metric (diagonal ones). This is a
 * safe default that will be overwritten by the caller based on geometric
 * measurements:
 *   - For vertices: M₀ = diag(ρ₀) set by initialize_metric_from_density()
 *   - For edges: M₁ computed by compute_edge_mass_matrix()
 *   - For triangles: M₂ would follow similar pattern if implemented
 *
 * BOUNDARY OPERATOR:
 * The boundary map B[p_new]: C_{p_new} → C_{p_new-1} is allocated with the
 * correct dimensions but contains no entries initially. The caller must
 * populate this by calling the appropriate boundary construction function:
 *   - B[1]: build_boundary_operator_from_edges()
 *   - B[2]: build_boundary_operator_from_triangles()
 *
 * The boundary operator is built from coface structures (vertex_cofaces,
 * edge_cofaces) rather than simplex tables, making this function independent
 * of the deprecated S and stars structures.
 *
 * DIMENSION COUNTING:
 * Unlike the old version that used S[p-1].size() to determine the number of
 * (p-1)-simplices, this version determines dimensions from coface structures:
 *   - n_0 (vertices) = vertex_cofaces.size()
 *   - n_1 (edges) = edge_registry.size()
 *   - n_2 (triangles) = maximum triangle index in edge_cofaces + 1
 *
 * LAPLACIAN ASSEMBLY:
 * The Hodge Laplacian L[p_new] is left empty and must be computed via
 * assemble_operators() after:
 *   1. All boundary operators B[p_new+1] and B[p_new] are populated
 *   2. The metric g.M[p_new] reflects the actual geometry
 *
 * The Laplacian at dimension p is given by the Hodge decomposition:
 *     L[p] = B[p+1]^T M[p+1]^{-1} B[p+1] + M[p]^{-1} B[p] M[p-1] B[p]^T
 *
 * INVARIANTS MAINTAINED:
 * After calling extend_by_one_dim(n_new):
 *   - pmax has increased by 1
 *   - g.M.size() == L.B.size() == L.L.size() == pmax + 1
 *   - g.M[pmax] is diagonal with n_new ones
 *   - L.B[pmax] is empty sparse matrix of shape (n_{pmax-1}, n_new)
 *   - All structures at dimensions 0, ..., pmax-1 are unchanged
 *
 * EFFICIENCY:
 * This operation is O(n_new) for initializing the new dimension's data
 * structures, plus O(pmax) for resizing dimension-indexed containers.
 * Critically, it does NOT rebuild or copy data from lower dimensions,
 * making it suitable for use during complex construction.
 *
 * THREAD SAFETY:
 * This function modifies the riem_dcx_t object and is NOT thread-safe. Do not
 * call concurrently from multiple threads on the same object.
 *
 * @param n_new Number of simplices at the new dimension p_new = pmax + 1.
 *              Must be non-negative. If zero, the dimension is added but
 *              contains no simplices (useful for maintaining consistent
 *              dimension indexing).
 *
 * @post pmax is incremented by 1
 * @post All dimension-indexed containers have size pmax + 1
 * @post g.M[pmax] is diagonal identity matrix of size n_new × n_new
 * @post L.B[pmax] is empty sparse matrix of appropriate shape
 * @post L.L[pmax] is empty (to be assembled later)
 * @post All data at dimensions 0, ..., pmax-1 (pre-increment) are unchanged
 *
 * @note The caller must subsequently:
 *       1. Populate appropriate coface structures (edge_registry, edge_cofaces, etc.)
 *       2. Set g.M[pmax] entries based on geometric measurements (via metric functions)
 *       3. Build L.B[pmax] by calling boundary construction functions
 *       4. Call assemble_operators() to compute L.L[pmax]
 *
 * @note If n_new = 0, the dimension exists but is empty. This is valid when
 *       no simplices of a given dimension exist (e.g., no triangles in a
 *       sparse graph).

/**
 * @brief Compute effective degrees for all vertices based on edge densities
 *
 * The effective degree of a vertex quantifies its connectivity strength in the
 * weighted graph structure. Unlike combinatorial degree (simple neighbor count),
 * effective degree accounts for edge weights through density masses, providing
 * a geometric measure of how well-connected a vertex is to its local neighborhood.
 *
 * MOTIVATION AND INTERPRETATION
 * ==============================
 *
 * In discrete graphs derived from continuous data, not all edges carry equal
 * geometric significance. Edges connecting vertices with large neighborhood
 * intersections represent strong geometric connections, while edges with small
 * intersections may be spurious artifacts of the k-NN construction. The effective
 * degree distinguishes these cases by weighting each edge by its density mass.
 *
 * For vertex i with incident edges e_1, e_2, ..., e_k, the effective degree is:
 *
 *   eff_deg(i) = Σⱼ ρ₁([i,j])
 *
 * where the sum runs over all neighbors j of vertex i, and ρ₁([i,j]) is the
 * edge density computed as the total vertex density in the pairwise neighborhood
 * intersection N̂_k(xᵢ) ∩ N̂_k(xⱼ).
 *
 * Vertices with high effective degree are well-integrated into the graph structure,
 * having many neighbors or neighbors connected through high-density edges. Vertices
 * with low effective degree are poorly connected, either having few neighbors or
 * neighbors connected through sparse intersections. The latter case identifies
 * outlier vertices that are weakly attached to the main data structure.
 *
 * RELATIONSHIP TO GRAPH ISOLATION
 * ================================
 *
 * Effective degree provides a continuous measure of vertex isolation. Classical
 * graph theory uses binary notions: a vertex is either isolated (degree 0) or
 * connected (degree > 0). In weighted graphs derived from statistical data,
 * isolation becomes a matter of degree rather than kind.
 *
 * A vertex with combinatorial degree k but very small effective degree has
 * k geometric connections, but all are weak. Such a vertex is effectively
 * isolated even though technically connected. This occurs for outlier data
 * points far from the main data cloud: their k nearest neighbors may be quite
 * distant, producing small neighborhood intersections and thus low edge densities.
 *
 * The effective degree thus serves as a natural filter for outlier detection
 * in the context of extrema identification. Spurious local extrema often appear
 * at isolated vertices. By filtering vertices with effective degree below some
 * threshold (e.g., 10th percentile), we remove problematic outliers before
 * applying extremum probability scoring.
 *
 * COMPUTATIONAL DETAILS
 * =====================
 *
 * This function computes effective degrees using the *initial* edge densities
 * established during graph initialization, before any iterative refinement.
 * This choice provides several advantages:
 *
 * 1. Stability: Initial densities capture the intrinsic geometry of the data
 *    distribution without response-dependent modulation. Effective degree
 *    becomes a fixed graph property independent of iteration history.
 *
 * 2. Interpretability: The effective degree represents pure geometric connectivity
 *    based on neighborhood overlap, uncontaminated by response coherence effects
 *    that modify edge densities during iteration.
 *
 * 3. Consistency: Initial edge densities are computed via the pairwise intersection
 *    formula ρ₁([i,j]) = Σᵥ∈N̂_k(xᵢ)∩N̂_k(xⱼ) ρ₀(v), matching the construction used
 *    in compute_initial_densities(). Using these values ensures effective degrees
 *    reflect the same geometric quantities used throughout initialization.
 *
 * The computation proceeds by iterating over all vertices and summing the density
 * values of their incident edges. Edge densities are stored in vertex_cofaces[i][k]
 * for k > 0, where vertex_cofaces[i][0] always represents the vertex itself.
 * Since edges appear twice (once in each endpoint's vertex_cofaces), we must
 * avoid double-counting by only accessing each edge once per vertex.
 *
 * COMPLEXITY ANALYSIS
 * ===================
 *
 * Time complexity: O(Σᵢ deg(i)) = O(n·k) where n is the number of vertices
 * and k is the average degree. For k-NN graphs, this is optimal since we must
 * examine every edge incident to every vertex.
 *
 * Space complexity: O(n) for the output vector. No additional space is required
 * beyond the input data structures.
 *
 * The function performs a single pass over vertex_cofaces, making it suitable
 * for large graphs with millions of vertices and edges.
 *
 * USAGE IN EXTREMA DETECTION PIPELINE
 * ====================================
 *
 * Effective degrees support the statistical extrema detection framework:
 *
 * 1. After graph initialization, call compute_effective_degrees() once to
 *    obtain the eff_deg vector.
 *
 * 2. Store eff_deg for use in post-processing extrema detection.
 *
 * 3. When identifying extrema via maxp/minp scoring, apply a pre-filter:
 *      candidates = vertices with maxp > 0.95 AND eff_deg > quantile(eff_deg, 0.10)
 *
 * 4. Compute hop-extremp radius only for candidates passing both filters,
 *    reducing computational cost by eliminating poorly-connected vertices early.
 *
 * This two-stage filtering (probabilistic scoring + connectivity) efficiently
 * identifies genuine extrema while discarding spurious peaks at outlier vertices.
 *
 * @return Vector of length n_vertices where entry i gives the effective degree
 *         of vertex i. All values are non-negative. Sum of all effective degrees
 *         equals twice the sum of all edge densities (since each edge contributes
 *         to two vertices).
 *
 * @pre vertex_cofaces is populated with graph topology
 * @pre vertex_cofaces[i][k].density contains edge densities for k > 0
 * @pre Edge densities have been initialized via compute_initial_densities()
 *
 * @post Returned vector has length equal to number of vertices
 * @post All returned values are non-negative
 * @post Vertices with no neighbors have effective degree 0
 *
 * @note This function uses initial edge densities, not evolved densities from
 *       iterative refinement. This ensures effective degree remains a stable
 *       graph property independent of the regression iteration history.
 *
 * @note The effective degree differs from the weighted degree in classical graph
 *       theory. Weighted degree typically uses edge weights representing costs or
 *       capacities. Effective degree uses edge densities representing geometric
 *       significance of connections in the underlying data distribution.

/**
 * @brief Compute hop-extremp radius for a vertex using incremental BFS
 *
 * This function determines the maximum hop distance at which a vertex maintains
 * a specified extremum probability (maxp or minp) threshold. Unlike the naive
 * approach of repeatedly calling BFS for each hop distance, this implementation
 * performs a single BFS traversal, testing the extremp condition incrementally
 * at each hop level.
 *
 * MOTIVATION AND PROBLEM STATEMENT
 * =================================
 *
 * The hop-extremp radius provides a spatial persistence measure for local extrema.
 * A vertex with large hop-extremp radius maintains its extremum character over
 * a large neighborhood, indicating a genuine, stable peak or valley. A vertex
 * with small hop-extremp radius may be a spurious extremum caused by local noise.
 *
 * The hop-extremp radius r_p(i) is defined as the largest hop distance h such that:
 *   extremp(i | N_h(i), y, ρ) ≥ p
 *
 * where N_h(i) is the h-hop neighborhood of vertex i, extremp is the probabilistic
 * extremum score (maxp or minp), and p is a threshold (typically 0.90 or 0.95).
 *
 * ALGORITHMIC APPROACH
 * ====================
 *
 * We perform a single BFS traversal, maintaining:
 * - Current hop neighborhood N_h(i) as we expand level by level
 * - Density-weighted sums for numerator and denominator of extremp score
 * - Cumulative extremp score at each hop level
 *
 * At each hop level h, we:
 * 1. Add newly discovered vertices at distance h to the neighborhood
 * 2. Update the running sums for extremp calculation
 * 3. Test if extremp(i | N_h(i), y, ρ) ≥ p
 * 4. If extremp drops below p, return h-1 as the hop-extremp radius
 *
 * This achieves O(V + E) complexity for the entire computation, where V is the
 * number of vertices and E is the number of edges in the graph.
 *
 * INCREMENTAL EXTREMP CALCULATION
 * ================================
 *
 * For maxima, we track:
 *   numerator   = Σ{ρ(j) : j ∈ N_h(i), y(i) > y(j)}
 *   denominator = Σ{ρ(j) : j ∈ N_h(i)}
 *   maxp(i | N_h(i)) = numerator / denominator
 *
 * As we expand from N_h to N_{h+1}, we add new vertices discovered at hop h+1:
 *   For each new vertex j:
 *     denominator += ρ(j)
 *     if y(i) > y(j): numerator += ρ(j)
 *
 * This incremental update requires only O(degree) work per hop level, avoiding
 * recomputation of the entire neighborhood score.
 *
 * SPECIAL CASES
 * =============
 *
 * Global extrema: If the vertex is a global extremum, it satisfies the extremp
 * condition over the entire graph. We return std::numeric_limits<size_t>::max()
 * to indicate infinite radius.
 *
 * Non-extrema: If the vertex fails the extremp condition even at hop 1, we
 * return 0 to indicate it is not a local extremum at any scale.
 *
 * Maximum hop limit: To prevent excessive computation on large graphs, we impose
 * a maximum hop limit (default 20). If extremp remains above threshold at this
 * limit, we return the limit value (not infinity, to distinguish from global extrema).
 *
 * @param vertex Index of the vertex to evaluate
 * @param y Vector of function values at each vertex (typically fitted values)
 * @param p_threshold Extremp threshold in (0,1], typically 0.90 or 0.95
 * @param detect_maxima If true, compute hop-maxp radius; if false, hop-minp radius
 * @param max_hop Maximum hop distance to explore (default 20)
 *
 * @return Hop-extremp radius: the largest h such that extremp(i | N_h(i)) ≥ p.
 *         Returns 0 if vertex is not a local extremum.
 *         Returns std::numeric_limits<size_t>::max() if vertex is global extremum.
 *         Returns max_hop if threshold still satisfied at maximum hop limit.
 *
 * @pre y.size() == vertex_cofaces.size()
 * @pre vertex < vertex_cofaces.size()
 * @pre 0 < p_threshold ≤ 1.0
 * @pre vertex_cofaces[i][0].density contains vertex densities ρ₀
 *
 * @complexity O(min(V + E, max_hop · average_degree)) where V is vertices, E is edges.
 *             In practice, terminates early when extremp drops below threshold.
 *
 * @note Uses vertex densities ρ₀ from vertex_cofaces[i][0].density for weighting.
 *       This matches the definition of maxp/minp in the R implementation.
