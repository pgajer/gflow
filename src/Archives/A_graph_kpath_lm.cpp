/**
 * @brief Computes local linear models on a graph structure
 *
 * @details This function fits local linear models at each vertex of the graph using paths
 * of length h that contain the vertex. For each vertex, it:
 * 1. Identifies paths of length h containing the vertex
 * 2. Selects paths where the vertex is closest to the midpoint
 * 3. Fits weighted linear models along these paths
 * 4. Averages predictions from multiple paths if they exist
 *
 * The weighting scheme combines:
 * - Optional input weights for each vertex
 * - Kernel weights based on distance along paths
 * - Normalization to handle different path scales
 *
 * @param path_graph Graph structure containing path and connectivity information
 * @param y Response values at each vertex
 * @param weights Optional vertex weights (must be empty or match y length)
 * @param h Path length for local linear models (must be odd: h = 2s + 1)
 * @param ikernel Integer specifying the kernel type for weight computation
 * @param dist_normalization_factor Factor for normalizing distances (default: 1.01)
 *
 * @return std::vector<double> Predicted values at each vertex based on local linear models
 *
 * @throws Rf_error if:
 * - h is not positive
 * - h is not odd
 * - ikernel is negative
 * - y.size() doesn't match number of vertices
 * - weights is non-empty and weights.size() doesn't match number of vertices
 * - dist_normalization_factor is not positive
 * - no valid paths are found for any vertex
 * - internal linear model fitting fails
 *
 * @pre h must be positive odd integer (h = 2s + 1 for some s â‰¥ 0)
 * @pre y.size() must equal path_graph.vertex_paths.size()
 * @pre weights must be empty or weights.size() must equal y.size()
 * @pre ikernel must be non-negative
 * @pre dist_normalization_factor must be positive
 *
 * @note Time Complexity: O(V * P * h) where:
 *       V is number of vertices
 *       P is average number of h-length paths per vertex
 *       h is path length
 *
 * @note The function implements a weighted local linear regression where:
 * - Each vertex prediction is based on paths of length h containing it
 * - Only paths where the vertex is closest to midpoint are used
 * - Weights combine user-provided weights and kernel-based distance weights
 * - Distances along paths are normalized by maximum path distance
 *
 * Example usage:
 * @code
 *     path_graph_plm_t graph = create_path_graph_plm(adj_list, weight_list, h);
 *     std::vector<double> y = {1.0, 2.0, 3.0}; // response values
 *     std::vector<double> weights = {}; // empty for uniform weights
 *     int h = 3; // path length
 *     int ikernel = 1; // kernel type
 *     auto predictions = graph_local_linear_model(graph, y, weights, h, ikernel);
 * @endcode
