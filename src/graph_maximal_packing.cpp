/**
 * @brief Creates a uniform grid graph with a maximal packing of vertices
 *
 * @details This function takes a graph representation (adjacency list and weight list),
 * constructs a set-based weighted graph, and computes a maximal packing of vertices
 * based on the specified grid size. A maximal packing is a subset of vertices where
 * no two vertices are closer than the grid size, and no additional vertex can be added
 * without violating this constraint.
 *
 * The algorithm first determines the diameter endpoints of the graph and then uses one
 * of these endpoints as the starting point for building the packing. It iteratively adds
 * vertices to the packing, ensuring they maintain proper spacing. The iteration process
 * continues until either convergence is reached (no more vertices can be added) or
 * the maximum number of iterations is exceeded.
 *
 * The returned uniform_grid_graph_t object inherits both the graph_diameter and
 * max_packing_radius values from the intermediate set_wgraph_t object, making these
 * calculated values available for further analysis.
 *
 * @param adj_list A vector of vectors representing the adjacency list of the graph,
 * where each inner vector contains the indices of neighbors for a vertex
 * @param weight_list A vector of vectors containing the edge weights corresponding to
 * the adjacency list, where weight_list[i][j] is the weight of the
 * edge from vertex i to adj_list[i][j]
 * @param grid_size The target spacing between vertices in the packing
 * @param max_iterations The maximum number of iterations for the packing algorithm
 * @param precision The convergence threshold for the algorithm
 *
 * @return A uniform_grid_graph_t object containing the original graph structure and the
 * computed maximal packing of vertices
 *
 * @note Both graph_diameter and max_packing_radius are copied to the returned object
 * through the uniform_grid_graph_t constructor, providing access to these computed values.
 *
 * @note The packing algorithm is implemented in the set_wgraph_t::create_maximal_packing
 *   method, which this function calls internally
 *
 * @see set_wgraph_t
 * @see uniform_grid_graph_t
 * @see set_wgraph_t::create_maximal_packing
