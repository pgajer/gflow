/**
 * @brief Helper structure to track vertices explored during the ε-packing algorithm
 *
 * @details This structure maintains a record of vertices that have been "explored"
 * during the construction of a maximal ε-packing. A vertex is considered "explored"
 * if it is within distance ε of any vertex in the current packing. This allows the
 * algorithm to efficiently track which vertices cannot be added to the packing due
 * to proximity constraints.
 *
 * The implementation uses a boolean vector to mark explored vertices and maintains
 * a counter of how many vertices have been explored so far, allowing for efficient
 * termination checks.
