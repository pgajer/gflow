/**
 * @brief Advanced harmonic smoothing with predictions landscape feature tracking
 *
 * @details This function extends the standard harmonic smoothing by tracking
 *          how local extrema and their basins evolve during the smoothing process.
 *          It aims to find the optimal "sweet spot" where noise is reduced but
 *          significant predictions landscape features are preserved.
 *
 * The algorithm proceeds through these key steps:
 * 1. Iteratively performs harmonic smoothing on the interior vertices
 * 2. Periodically captures the current function values and identifies local extrema/basins
 * 3. Monitors the stability of predictions landscape structure
 * 4. Identifies the iteration where predictions landscape structure stabilizes
 * 5. Returns both the smoothed values and the history of predictions landscape evolution
 *
 * @param[in,out] harmonic_predictions Vector of function values to be smoothed in place
 * @param[in] region_vertices Set of vertex indices that define the region to smooth
 * @param[in] max_iterations Maximum number of relaxation iterations to perform (default: 100)
 * @param[in] tolerance Convergence threshold for value changes (default: 1e-6)
 * @param[in] record_frequency Frequency at which to record states (default: 1, record every iteration)
 * @param[in] stability_window Number of consecutive iterations to check for stability (default: 3)
 * @param[in] stability_threshold Threshold for considering predictions landscape stable (default: 0.05)
 *
 * @return A harmonic_smoother_t structure containing:
 *         - i_harmonic_predictions: Vector of function values at recorded iterations
 *         - i_basins: Vector of extrema basin maps at recorded iterations
 *         - stable_iteration: The iteration where predictions landscape stabilized
 *         - basin_cx_differences: Differences between consecutive recorded iterations
 *
 * @pre The size of harmonic_predictions must match the number of vertices in the graph
 * @pre All vertices in region_vertices must have valid indices less than the graph size
 *
 * @see perform_harmonic_smoothing
 * @see compute_basins
