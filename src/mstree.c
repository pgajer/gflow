    \brief Creates a Minimal Spanning Tree (MST) on a matrix X with > 1 column using Prim's algorithm

    This function implements Prim's algorithm to construct a Minimal Spanning Tree (MST)
    from a given set of points. The algorithm works as follows:

    1. Start with an initial point (specified by riinit).
    2. Initialize the tree T with this point.
    3. While T does not include all points:
       a. Find the point not in T that is closest to any point in T.
       b. Add this point to T and the corresponding edge to the MST.
    4. Repeat step 3 until all points are included in T.

    The function uses pre-computed nearest neighbor information (nn_i and nn_d) to
    efficiently find the closest points at each step.

    \param riinit     Pointer to the index of the starting column in X for tree construction.
    \param nn_i       2D array [(n_points-1) x n_points] containing indices of (n_points - 1)
                      nearest neighbors for each point in X.
    \param nn_d       2D array [(n_points-1) x n_points] containing distances to (n_points - 1)
                      nearest neighbors for each point in X.
    \param rldist     Pointer to a value greater than all distances in nn_d (used as infinity).
    \param rn_points  Pointer to the number of points in X (number of columns in nn_i and nn_d).
    \param edges      Output 2D array [2 x (n_points - 1)] containing edges of the MST of X.
    \param edge_lens  Output array of edge lengths in the MST.

    \note The function assumes that memory for output arrays (edges and edge_lens)
          has been allocated by the caller.
    \note The function uses dynamic memory allocation for internal data structures
          and frees this memory before returning.
