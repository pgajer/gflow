\title{Extract Model Weights from Graph Spectral MA LOWESS}
\usage{
\method{weights}{graph.spectral.ma.lowess}(object, vertex = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{A 'graph.spectral.ma.lowess' object}

\item{vertex}{Optional vertex index to get weights for specific vertex}

\item{...}{Additional arguments (currently unused)}
}
\value{
Matrix of model weights (vertices x bandwidths) or vector for specific vertex
}
\description{
Extracts the weights assigned to each bandwidth model in the averaging process.
This function is specific to the model-averaged version.
