\title{Calculate Overlap Coefficients Between Basins of Attraction}
\usage{
boa.overlap(x, y, min.BoA.size, x.labels = NULL, y.labels = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Named integer vector where values are indices of local maxima and names
are IDs of points in the basin for variable X}

\item{y}{Named integer vector where values are indices of local maxima and names
are IDs of points in the basin for variable Y}

\item{min.BoA.size}{Minimum number of elements required for a basin to be included}

\item{x.labels}{Named vector of labels for basins in x. Names must match unique values in x.}

\item{y.labels}{Named vector of labels for basins in y. Names must match unique values in y.}
}
\value{
A matrix where rows correspond to BoAs from x and columns to BoAs from y,
containing their pairwise overlap coefficients. Only includes BoAs meeting
the size threshold. Row and column names are taken from x.labels and y.labels
if provided, otherwise from the local maxima indices.
}
\description{
Computes a matrix of overlap coefficients between basins of attraction (BoA)
identified by local maxima indices in two variables. Only includes BoAs that meet
the minimum size requirement.

\examples{
ids <- paste0("id", 1:500)
x <- c(rep(1, 200), rep(2, 300))
names(x) <- ids
y <- c(rep(1, 150), rep(2, 350))
names(y) <- ids
x.labels <- c("1" = "Peak A", "2" = "Peak B")
y.labels <- c("1" = "Max 1", "2" = "Max 2")
boa.overlap(x, y, min.BoA.size = 100, x.labels = x.labels, y.labels = y.labels)
