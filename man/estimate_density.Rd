\title{Define a function to estimate the density rho_S(X)}
\usage{
estimate_density(point, X)
}
\arguments{
\item{point}{A numeric vector representing a point in the state space.}

\item{X}{A matrix where each row represents a point in the state space, used
as the reference dataset for density estimation.}
}
\value{
A numeric value representing the estimated density at the given point.
Currently returns 1 as a placeholder implementation.
}
\description{
This is a placeholder for a density estimation function. In practice, this
might use methods like kernel density estimation.
}
\details{
This function is intended to estimate the density of points in a high-dimensional
space. The current implementation returns a constant value of 1, serving as a
placeholder. In production use, this should be replaced with an appropriate
density estimation method such as:
\itemize{
\item Kernel density estimation (KDE)
\item k-nearest neighbors density estimation
\item Gaussian mixture models
}
}
\note{
This is a placeholder implementation. Users should replace this with an
appropriate density estimation method for their specific use case.
}
\examples{
# Current placeholder usage
X <- matrix(rnorm(100), ncol=2)
point <- c(0, 0)
density <- estimate_density(point, X)  # Returns 1
