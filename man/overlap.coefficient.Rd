\title{Calculate the Overlap Coefficient Between Two Numeric Vectors}
\usage{
overlap.coefficient(x, y)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A numeric vector representing the first set}

\item{y}{A numeric vector representing the second set}
}
\value{
A numeric value between 0 and 1, where:
\itemize{
\item 1 indicates that one set is a subset of the other
\item 0 indicates the sets are disjoint
\item Values between 0 and 1 indicate partial overlap
}
}
\description{
Computes the Overlap Coefficient (also known as Szymkiewicz-Simpson coefficient)
between two numeric vectors treated as sets. The coefficient is defined as the size
of the intersection divided by the size of the smaller set. Duplicates are removed
before calculation.
}
\examples{
overlap.coefficient(c(1, 2, 3), c(1, 2, 3))     # Returns 1
overlap.coefficient(c(1, 2), c(1, 2, 3, 4))     # Returns 1
overlap.coefficient(c(1, 2, 2, 3), c(1, 2, 4))  # Returns 0.67
overlap.coefficient(c(1, 2), c(3, 4))           # Returns 0
overlap.coefficient(numeric(0), c(1, 2))        # Returns 0
