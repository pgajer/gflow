\title{Print Method for Basin Complex Summary Objects}
\usage{
\method{print}{summary.basin_cx}(x, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An object of class "summary.basin_cx" as created by
\code{\link{summary.basin_cx}}.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to print methods (currently unused).}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns the input summary object \code{x}. This function is called
for its side effect of printing detailed information to the console.
}
\description{
Prints a formatted, comprehensive summary of a gradient flow basin complex,
including detailed statistics about extrema, basins, basin overlaps, and
cell complex structure.
}
\details{
The print method displays the following sections:

\strong{Extrema:} Total counts of local extrema, broken down by minima and maxima.

\strong{Local Minima/Maxima Information:} Tables showing each extremum with its
vertex index, label, basin size, and function value. Minima are sorted by
increasing function value, maxima by decreasing function value.

\strong{Basins:} Counts of merged ascending (minimum) and descending (maximum)
basins, along with size statistics.

\strong{Basin Size Statistics:} Summary statistics (min, quartiles, mean, max)
for the number of vertices in each type of basin.

\strong{Cell Complex Summary:} Total number of cells and breakdown by type
(ascending-descending, ascending-ascending, descending-descending).

\strong{Jaccard Index Matrices:} Matrices showing pairwise Jaccard indices
(overlap measures) between basins of the same type, rounded to 3 decimal places.

\strong{Messages:} Any informational messages generated during basin complex
creation.
