\alias{centroid.shift}
\title{Subtracts the centroid from each point of the given dataset.}
\usage{
centroid.shift(X, centroid = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{A matrix or data.frame specifying a set of points, where each row represents
a point and each column represents a dimension.}

\item{centroid}{A numeric vector specifying the centroid to subtract from each point.
If NULL (default), the centroid is computed as the column means of X.
Must have length equal to ncol(X).}
}
\value{
A numeric matrix of the same dimensions as X, with the centroid subtracted
from each row. The returned matrix represents the centered dataset.
}
\description{
This function centers a dataset by subtracting a centroid from each point (row).
If no centroid is provided, it computes the centroid as the column means of X.
}
\examples{
# Example 1: Auto-compute centroid
X <- matrix(c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), nrow = 3, ncol = 2)
centroid.shift(X)

# Example 2: Provide custom centroid
X <- matrix(c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), nrow = 3, ncol = 2)
custom_centroid <- c(2, 5)
centroid.shift(X, centroid = custom_centroid)
}
