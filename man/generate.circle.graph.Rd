\title{Generate a Circle Graph}
\usage{
generate.circle.graph(n, type = "random", seed = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{A positive integer specifying the number of vertices in the graph.}

\item{type}{Character string specifying the type of angle distribution. Either "uniform" for
equally spaced angles or "random" for random angles. Default is "random".}

\item{seed}{Optional seed for the random number generator. Default is NULL.}
}
\value{
A list with two components:
\item{adj.list}{Adjacency list of the circle graph. Each element \code{adj.list[[i]]} contains
the vertices adjacent to vertex i.}
\item{weight.list}{Weight list corresponding to the adjacency list. Each element
\code{weight.list[[i]]} contains the weights of the edges connecting
vertex i to the vertices in \code{adj.list[[i]]}.}
}
\description{
Creates a circle graph where each vertex is connected to the vertices to its left and right.
The edge weight is the angular distance (shortest angle) between connected vertices.
}
\examples{
# Generate a circle graph with 5 vertices and uniform angles
graph <- generate.circle.graph(5, type = "uniform")

# Generate a circle graph with 10 vertices and random angles
graph <- generate.circle.graph(10, type = "random", seed = 123)
