\title{Create Pruned Intersection Size List}
\usage{
create.pruned.isize.list(adj.list, isize.list, pruned.adj.list)
}
\arguments{
\item{adj.list}{A list where each element represents a node and contains indices of its neighbors
in the original graph.}

\item{isize.list}{A list of the same length as adj.list, where each element contains intersection
sizes corresponding to the edges in adj.list.}

\item{pruned.adj.list}{A list representing the pruned graph, where each element contains indices
of neighbors after removing redundant edges.}
}
\value{
A list of the same length as pruned.adj.list, where each element contains intersection
sizes corresponding to the edges in the pruned graph.
}
\description{
This function generates a list of intersection sizes for the edges of a pruned adjacency list.
It takes the original adjacency list, intersection size list, and pruned adjacency list as inputs,
and returns a new list containing intersection sizes corresponding to the pruned graph structure.
}
\details{
The function iterates through each node in the pruned adjacency list. For each node, it identifies
the neighbors in the pruned graph and retrieves their corresponding intersection sizes from the
original isize.list. The resulting pruned.isize.list maintains the structure of pruned.adj.list
but contains intersection sizes instead of neighbor indices.
}
\note{
\itemize{
\item The function assumes that all nodes present in pruned.adj.list are also present in adj.list
and isize.list.
\item If a neighbor in pruned.adj.list is not found in the original adj.list (which should not happen
under normal circumstances), the corresponding intersection size will be set to NA.

# Example usage:
adj.list <- list(c(2,3,4), c(1,3), c(1,2,4), c(1,3))
isize.list <- list(c(2,1,3), c(2,1), c(1,1,2), c(3,2))
pruned.adj.list <- list(c(2,4), c(1), c(4), c(1,3))
pruned.isize.list <- create.pruned.isize.list(adj.list, isize.list, pruned.adj.list)
print(pruned.isize.list)
