\title{Computes the length of a path specified by a matrix X.}
\usage{
path.length(X)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{A matrix of points along a path.}
}
\value{
A numeric value representing the total Euclidean length of the path
defined by consecutive points in X.
}
\description{
Computes the length of a path specified by a matrix X.
}
\details{
This function calculates the total path length by summing the Euclidean distances
between consecutive points (rows) in the matrix X. Each row of X represents a
point in the path, and columns represent dimensions.
}
\examples{
# Create a simple path in 2D
path_points <- matrix(c(0,0, 1,0, 1,1, 0,1), ncol=2, byrow=TRUE)
length <- path.length(path_points)
# length will be 3 (three unit-length segments)

# 3D path example
path_3d <- matrix(c(0,0,0, 1,0,0, 1,1,0, 1,1,1), ncol=3, byrow=TRUE)
length_3d <- path.length(path_3d)
