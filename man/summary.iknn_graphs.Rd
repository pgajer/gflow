\title{Summarize an iknn_graphs Object}
\usage{
\method{summary}{iknn_graphs}(object, use_double_pruned = TRUE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{An object of class 'iknn_graphs', typically the output of create.iknn.graphs().}

\item{use_double_pruned}{Logical. If TRUE, computes and displays statistics for the multi-stage
pruned graphs (double_pruned_graphs). If FALSE (default), computes statistics for the
first-stage pruned graphs (pruned_graphs). The multi-stage pruned graphs incorporate
additional long-edge and path-ratio pruning beyond the basic geometric pruning.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to or from other methods (not currently used).}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns a data frame containing statistics for each graph. The data frame has the following columns:
\item{idx}{The index of the given k value}
\item{k}{The k value for the intersection kNN graph}
\item{n_ccomp}{Number of connected components of the graph}
\item{edges}{Number of edges in the graph}
\item{mean_degree}{Average number of connections per vertex}
\item{min_degree}{Minimum vertex degree (least connected vertex)}
\item{max_degree}{Maximum vertex degree (most connected vertex)}
\item{sparsity}{Graph sparsity, calculated as 1 - density. It measures how many (proportion) potential connections are missing.}
}
\description{
Provides a detailed summary of an iknn_graphs object created by the create.iknn.graphs() function.
The summary includes statistics for each intersection kNN graph in the sequence, displaying information
about the connectivity and structure of the graphs for different k values.
}
\details{
The summary function extracts and presents key statistics about the structure of each
intersection kNN graph in the iknn_graphs object. All graphs share the same number of vertices
(equal to the number of rows in the input data matrix), but they differ in the number of edges
due to varying k values and the pruning threshold applied during graph creation.

The function displays general information about the graph sequence, including the number of vertices,
the range of k values, and the pruning threshold used. It then presents a tabular summary of statistics
for each individual graph, showing how the graph structure changes as k increases.

For each intersection kNN graph, the following metrics are calculated:
\itemize{
\item Number of edges: Total number of connections in the graph
\item Mean degree: Average number of connections per vertex
\item Min/Max degree: Range of vertex connectivity
\item Density: Proportion of potential connections that are actually present
}

\examples{
# Create sample data
set.seed(123)
x <- matrix(rnorm(1000), ncol = 5)

# Generate intersection kNN graphs
iknn.res <- create.iknn.graphs(x, kmin = 3, kmax = 10, pruning.thld = 0.7)

# Summarize the graphs
summary(iknn.res)

# Store the summary statistics for further analysis
graph_stats <- summary(iknn.res)
