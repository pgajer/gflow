\title{Compute Constrained Gradient Flow Trajectories}
\usage{
graph.constrained.gradient.flow.trajectories(graph, core.graph, Ey)
}
\arguments{
\item{graph}{List of integer vectors representing the h-th power graph pIG_k^h(X)}

\item{core.graph}{List of integer vectors representing the core graph pIG_k(X)}

\item{Ey}{Numeric vector of function values at vertices}
}
\value{
List containing:
\itemize{
\item lext - Matrix with two columns containing local minima and maxima for each vertex
\item trajectories - List of integer vectors containing complete trajectories
}
}
\description{
Computes gradient flow trajectories on a graph while preventing basin-jumping between
different regions of attraction by enforcing monotonicity along paths in a core graph.
}
\details{
The function ensures that trajectories follow paths that are monotonic in the core graph,
preventing undesirable jumps between basins of attraction of different local maxima.
Indices in graph and core.graph are converted from 1-based (R) to 0-based (C++) indexing.
