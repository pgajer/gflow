\title{Bump Function}
\usage{
bump.fn(x, offset = 0, h = 1, q = 4)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A numeric vector or a single numeric value where the bump function is evaluated.}

\item{offset}{The center (offset) of the bump function (defaults to 0).
The function reaches its maximum value at this point.}

\item{h}{The radius of the support of the bump function (defaults to 1).
The function is zero outside the interval \eqn{[offset - h, offset + h]}.}

\item{q}{The power to which the Gaussian function is raised (defaults to 4).}
}
\value{
A numeric vector or a single numeric value representing the value(s) of the bump function
at the input \code{x}. The values are in the range \eqn{[0, 1]}, with the function smoothly approaching
zero at the boundaries of its support.
}
\description{
This function creates a bump function, which is a smooth function with compact support.
The bump function is commonly used in mathematical analysis, particularly in the construction
of partitions of unity. The function reaches its peak at the \code{offset} and smoothly decreases
to zero at the boundary of its support.
}
\details{
The bump function is defined as exp(-1 / (h - (x - offset)^2)) for |x - offset| < h, and 0 otherwise.
It is infinitely differentiable and is used in situations where a smooth function with compact
support is needed.

\examples{
\dontrun{
x <- seq(-2, 2, length.out = 100)
plot(x, bump.fn(x), type = "l")
}
