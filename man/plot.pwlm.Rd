\usage{
\method{plot}{pwlm}(
  x,
  main = "Piecewise Linear Regression",
  xlab = "X",
  ylab = "Y",
  point_color = "black",
  line_color = "blue",
  breakpoint_color = "red",
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An object of class "pwlm", typically the output of fit.pwlm().}

\item{main}{Character string for plot title. Default is "Piecewise Linear Regression".}

\item{xlab}{Character string for x-axis label. Default is "X".}

\item{ylab}{Character string for y-axis label. Default is "Y".}

\item{point_color}{Color for data points. Default is "black".}

\item{line_color}{Color for fitted lines. Default is "blue".}

\item{breakpoint_color}{Color for breakpoint vertical lines. Default is "red".}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to plot().}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns NULL. The function is called for its side effect of creating a plot.
}
\description{
Creates a visualization of a piecewise linear model fit, showing the data points,
fitted lines, and breakpoints. This function handles both segmented models with
breakpoints and simple linear models.

\examples{
# Generate sample data
set.seed(123)
x <- 1:20
y <- c(1:10, 20:11) + rnorm(20, 0, 2)

# Fit piecewise linear model with one breakpoint
pwlm_fit <- fit.pwlm(x, y)

# Plot the model
\dontrun{
  plot(pwlm_fit)

  # Customize plot appearance
  plot(pwlm_fit, main = "My Custom PWLM Plot",
       point_color = "blue", line_color = "red")
}
