\title{Compute Wasserstein Divergence Between Two Point Sets}
\usage{
wasserstein.divergence(X, Y, k)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{A numeric matrix where each row represents a point in n-dimensional space.}

\item{Y}{A numeric matrix with the same dimensions as X, representing the second point set.}

\item{k}{An integer specifying the number of nearest neighbors to consider.}
}
\value{
A numeric value representing the sum of Wasserstein distances between local neighborhoods.
}
\description{
This function calculates a modified Wasserstein divergence between two point sets X and Y.
It uses k-nearest neighbors in X to define local neighborhoods, and computes the
Wasserstein distance between corresponding neighborhoods in X and Y.
}
\details{
The function first checks the validity of inputs, then uses k-nearest neighbors to define
local neighborhoods in X. For each neighborhood, it computes the 2-Wasserstein distance
between the corresponding points in X and Y, using Euclidean ground distance.
The final divergence is the sum of these local Wasserstein distances.
}
\note{
This function requires the 'FNN' package for k-nearest neighbor calculations and
the 'transport' package for Wasserstein distance computations.

X <- matrix(rnorm(1000 * 3), nrow = 1000, ncol = 3)
Y <- matrix(rnorm(1000 * 3), nrow = 1000, ncol = 3)
div <- wasserstein.divergence(X, Y, k = 10)
