\arguments{
\item{adj_list}{Adjacency list representation of the graph}

\item{weights_list}{List of edge weights (optional)}

\item{invert_weights}{Whether to invert weights (useful when weights represent similarities)}

\item{dim}{Number of dimensions for the embedding (default: 2)}

\item{method}{Layout algorithm to use: "fr" for Fruchterman-Reingold or "kk" for Kamada-Kawai}

\item{verbose}{Whether to print progress information}
}

\description{
Computes a 2D layout for a graph using force-directed algorithms.

Computes a 2D layout for a graph using force-directed algorithms.
}
\details{
This function implements force-directed graph layout algorithms to position
vertices in a 2D space. The goal is to position connected vertices close to
each other while keeping unconnected vertices far apart.
