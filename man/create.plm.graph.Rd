\title{Create a Path Length Matrix Graph Structure}
\usage{
create.plm.graph(graph, edge.lengths, h)
}
\arguments{
\item{graph}{A list where each element \code{i} is a numeric vector containing the
indices of vertices adjacent to vertex \code{i}. Vertex indices should be
1-based. For undirected graphs, edges should be present in both directions.}

\item{edge.lengths}{A list of the same structure as \code{graph} where each element
contains the weights/lengths of the corresponding edges in \code{graph}.}

\item{h}{An odd positive integer specifying the maximum path length (in hops) to be
precomputed. Common values are 3, 5, or 7.}
}
\value{
An S3 object of class "path.graph.plm" containing:
\describe{
\item{adj_list}{Adjacency list representation of the graph}
\item{edge_length_list}{List of edge weights}
\item{hop_list}{List of hop counts for paths}
\item{shortest_paths}{Precomputed paths information}
\item{vertex_paths}{Information about paths containing each vertex}
\item{h}{The hop limit used}
}
}
\description{
Creates a PLM (Path Length Matrix) graph structure from an adjacency list
representation of an undirected graph with edge weights. This structure is
optimized for computing path-based statistics and contains precomputed paths
of specified length.
}
\details{
The PLM (Path Length Matrix) structure is designed for efficient computation
of path-based network statistics. It precomputes all paths up to length \code{h}
and stores them in a format that allows rapid queries. The restriction to odd
values of \code{h} is often used in certain network analysis contexts where
paths of odd length have special significance.

For undirected graphs, ensure that if edge (i,j) exists, then edge (j,i)
also exists in the input with the same weight.
}
\note{
This function is memory-intensive for large graphs or large values of \code{h},
as it stores all paths up to length \code{h}.

# Create a simple path graph with 3 vertices: 1 -- 2 -- 3
graph <- list(c(2), c(1, 3), c(2))
edge.lengths <- list(c(1), c(1, 1), c(1))

# Create PLM graph with paths up to length 3
plm_graph <- create.plm.graph(graph, edge.lengths, h = 3)
