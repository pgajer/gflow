\title{Extract vertices belonging to a specific basin from a basin complex}
\usage{
get.basin.vertices(x, id)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An object of class 'basin_cx', typically returned by \code{create.basin.cx()}}

\item{id}{A character string specifying the basin label to extract (e.g., "M1" for first maximum, "m2" for second minimum)}
}
\value{
An integer vector containing the sorted vertex indices belonging to the specified basin
}
\description{
This function extracts all vertex indices that belong to a specified basin from
a gradient flow basin complex object. The basin is identified by its label (e.g., "M1" or "m2").
}
\details{
Basin labels follow the naming convention of the basin complex: "Mx" for maxima
basins and "mx" for minima basins, where x is a sequential number assigned based
on function value ordering.
