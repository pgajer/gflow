\title{Constructs the 1-skeleton (nerve graph) of the nerve simplicial complex associate with a covering of some finite set}
\usage{
nerve.graph(covering.list, n.cores = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{covering.list}{A list where each component is an integer vector
representing the indices of elements in a subset of the set being
covered. The list represents a covering of the set.}

\item{n.cores}{An integer specifying the number of cores for parallel
processing. If NULL, it defaults to \code{detectCores() - 1}. If set to 1,
parallel processing is not used. Based on limited experimental data,
the parallel processing becomes a viable option when the length of the
list is more than 100.}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\item{adjacency.list}{The adjacency list representation of the nerve graph}
\item{weights.list}{The weights (intersection sizes) for each edge}
\item{adjacency.matrix}{The sparse adjacency matrix with intersection sizes as entries}
}
\description{
This function constructs the 1-skeleton of the nerve of a given covering of
a set. The covering is represented as a list of components, each being an
integer index of the elements of the set. The function returns an adjacency
list representing the graph. Parallel processing can be utilized by
specifying the number of cores.
}
\details{
The nerve of a covering is a simplicial complex where each set in the covering
corresponds to a vertex, and vertices are connected by an edge if and only if
the corresponding sets have a non-empty intersection. This function constructs
the 1-skeleton (graph) of this nerve complex, with edge weights equal to the
size of the intersection between sets.

\examples{
covering.list <- list(c(1, 2), c(2, 3), c(1, 3, 4))
nerve.graph(covering.list, n.cores = 2)
