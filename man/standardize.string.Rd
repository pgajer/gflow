\title{Standardize String for File Names}
\usage{
standardize.string(str)
}
\arguments{
\item{str}{Character string to be standardized. Typically a name that needs
to be converted to a valid file name or identifier.}
}
\value{
Character string with special characters removed or replaced:
\itemize{
\item Commas, spaces, and forward slashes are replaced with underscores
\item Parentheses, colons, asterisks, apostrophes, and plus signs are removed
}
}
\description{
Removes special characters from a string and replaces spaces with underscores
to create valid file names or standardized identifiers.
}
\details{
This function is useful for converting names (such as metabolite
names, sample identifiers, or feature names) into standardized formats
suitable for use as file names or database keys. The function performs
literal character replacement, not regular expression matching.
}
\examples{
# Standardize a metabolite name
standardize.string("Glucose (6-phosphate)")
# Returns: "Glucose_6-phosphate"

# Standardize a complex name
standardize.string("Compound A/B + C's metabolite*")
# Returns: "Compound_A_B__Cs_metabolite"

# Use for creating file names
sample_name <- "Sample 1: Day 3 (replicate)"
file_name <- paste0(standardize.string(sample_name), ".csv")
# Results in: "Sample_1_Day_3_replicate.csv"

}
