\title{Create a Synthetic Mixture of Circular Gaussians}
\usage{
circular.synthetic.mixture.of.gaussians(x, x.knot, y.knot, sd.knot)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A numeric vector of angles (in radians) at which to evaluate the
mixture function.}

\item{x.knot}{A numeric vector specifying the centers of the Gaussian
distributions on the circle, in radians.}

\item{y.knot}{A numeric vector specifying the heights of the Gaussian
distributions. Must have the same length as x.knot.}

\item{sd.knot}{A positive numeric value specifying the standard deviation
for all Gaussian distributions in the mixture.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of the same length as x, containing the values of
the Gaussian mixture function evaluated at the input angles.
}
\description{
This function generates a mixture of periodic Gaussian distributions on a
circle. It ensures that the resulting function is smooth and continuous at
all points, including the 0/2pi connection point.
}
\details{
The function uses a periodic Gaussian distribution to ensure smoothness and
continuity around the entire circle. It calculates the shortest distance
between points on the circle in both clockwise and counterclockwise
directions, ensuring proper wrapping at the 0/2pi point.
}
\examples{
# Generate a simple circular Gaussian mixture
x <- seq(0, 2*pi, length.out = 100)
y <- circular.synthetic.mixture.of.gaussians(
  x,
  x.knot = c(0, pi, 1.5*pi),
  y.knot = c(5, 8, 2.5),
  sd.knot = 0.3
)

# Plot the result
plot(x, y, type = "l", xlab = "Angle (radians)", ylab = "Value")
