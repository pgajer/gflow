\title{Calculate Wasserstein Distance Between 1D Samples}
\usage{
wasserstein.distance.1D(x, y)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A numeric vector representing a sample from the first distribution.}

\item{y}{A numeric vector representing a sample from the second distribution.}
}
\value{
A single numeric value representing the Wasserstein distance between the two samples.
}
\description{
This function computes the Wasserstein distance (also known as Earth Mover's Distance)
between two samples from one-dimensional distributions.
}
\details{
The Wasserstein distance is calculated by sorting both input samples and computing
the average absolute difference between the sorted values. This implementation uses
a C function for efficient computation.

Both input vectors must have the same length, contain only numeric values, and all
elements must be finite.

\examples{
x <- rnorm(1000)
y <- rnorm(1000, mean = 1)
dist <- wasserstein.distance.1D(x, y)
