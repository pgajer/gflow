\title{Generate Uniform Random Sample from n-dimensional Torus}
\usage{
runif.torus(n.pts, dim = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{n.pts}{numeric; Number of points to generate}

\item{dim}{numeric; Dimension of the torus (default = 1, which gives points on a circle)}
}
\value{
A matrix with n.pts rows and 2*dim columns. Each row represents a point
on the torus, with pairs of columns representing the (x,y) coordinates of each
circular component.
}
\description{
Generates points uniformly distributed on an n-dimensional torus. Each point on the
torus is represented by its embedding in 2n-dimensional Euclidean space, where each
pair of coordinates represents a circle in a different dimension.
}
\details{
The n-dimensional torus is the product of n circles. For each dimension, a random
angle is generated uniformly in \code{[0, 2pi]}, and its sine and cosine give the
coordinates of the point's projection onto that circular component. The resulting
points are uniformly distributed with respect to the natural (product) measure
on the torus.
}
\examples{
# Generate 100 points on a circle (1-dimensional torus)
circle_points <- runif.torus(100, dim = 1)

# Generate 100 points on a 2-dimensional torus
torus_points <- runif.torus(100, dim = 2)
