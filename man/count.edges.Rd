\title{Count Edges in an Undirected Graph}
\usage{
count.edges(adj.list)
}
\arguments{
\item{adj.list}{A list where each element \code{adj.list[[i]]} contains the neighbors
of vertex \code{i} as a vector of indices. For an undirected graph, if \code{j} is in
\code{adj.list[[i]]}, then \code{i} should also be in \code{adj.list[[j]]}.}
}
\value{
A numeric value representing the number of edges in the graph.
Returns 0 for an empty graph.
}
\description{
Computes the total number of edges in an undirected graph represented by an adjacency list.
This function works by counting all neighbor connections across the graph and then
dividing by 2, since each edge is represented twice in an undirected graph (once
from each endpoint).
}
\examples{
# Create an adjacency list for a simple undirected graph
# with 3 vertices and 2 edges: (1-2) and (2-3)
adj <- list(
  c(2),    # Vertex 1 is connected to vertex 2
  c(1, 3), # Vertex 2 is connected to vertices 1 and 3
  c(2)     # Vertex 3 is connected to vertex 2
)
count.edges(adj)  # Should return 2
