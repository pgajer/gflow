\title{Plot a Matrix of Binary Time Series as Line Segments}
\usage{
\method{plot}{bars.matrix}(
  bars,
  kmin,
  time.range = NULL,
  col = "gray",
  xlab = "Time",
  ylab = "Sample",
  main = "Bar Plot Matrix"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{bars}{A matrix of 0s and 1s where rows represent time points and columns represent samples}

\item{kmin}{Numeric value indicating the starting time point (used for x-axis scaling)}

\item{time.range}{Optional numeric vector of time points. If NULL, defaults to kmin + 0:(nrow(bars) - 1)}

\item{col}{Character string specifying the color of the line segments. Default is "gray"}

\item{xlab}{Character string for x-axis label. Default is "Time"}

\item{ylab}{Character string for y-axis label. Default is "Sample"}

\item{main}{Character string for plot title. Default is "Bar Plot Matrix"}
}
\value{
A plot is produced on the current graphics device
}
\description{
Creates a visualization of a binary (0/1) matrix where each column represents a time series
and consecutive 1s are shown as line segments. This is particularly useful for visualizing
temporal events or periods of activity across multiple samples.
}
\details{
The function visualizes each column of the input matrix as a horizontal series of line segments,
where consecutive 1s in the matrix are represented by continuous lines. The y-axis represents
different samples (columns), while the x-axis represents time points (rows).
}
\examples{
# Create a sample matrix
bars <- matrix(0, nrow = 10, ncol = 5)
bars[2:4, 1] <- 1
bars[6:8, 2] <- 1

# Basic plot
plot.bars.matrix(bars, kmin = 1)

# Customized plot
plot.bars.matrix(bars, kmin = 1,
                col = "blue",
                xlab = "Time Point",
                ylab = "Sample ID",
                main = "Sample Timeline")

}
