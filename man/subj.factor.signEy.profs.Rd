\title{Sings of the derivatives of the E.geodesic.F profiles.}
\usage{
subj.factor.signEy.profs(save.file.prefix, rlabs, grid.size = 400)
}
\arguments{
\item{save.file.prefix}{The prefix of the save() files.}

\item{rlabs}{Labels of the subject factors with levels.}

\item{grid.size}{Grid size in E.geodesic.F estimates.}
}
\value{
A matrix with dimensions length(rlabs) x (grid.size-1) containing the signs
of the derivatives of the E.geodesic.F profiles. Each row corresponds to a factor
in rlabs, and each column represents the sign of the derivative at consecutive
grid points. Values are 1 for positive derivatives, -1 for negative derivatives,
and NA for factors without corresponding data files.
}
\description{
Sings of the derivatives of the E.geodesic.F profiles.
}
\details{
This function computes the signs of the derivatives (differences) of the expected
value profiles generated by E.geodesic.F. For each factor, it loads the saved
results and calculates whether the expected values are increasing (sign = 1) or
decreasing (sign = -1) between consecutive grid points along the geodesic.
