\title{Create a Single Intersection-weighted k-Nearest Neighbors Graph}
\usage{
create.single.iknn.graph(
  X,
  k,
  pruning.thld = 0.1,
  compute.full = FALSE,
  pca.dim = 100,
  variance.explained = 0.99,
  verbose = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{A numeric matrix where rows represent data points and columns represent features.
Data frames will be coerced to matrices.}

\item{k}{Integer scalar. The number of nearest neighbors to consider for each point.
Must be positive and less than the number of data points.}

\item{pruning.thld}{numeric, controlling intensity of the geometric edge pruning.
Edge weight relative deviation is computed as
rel_dev = (w_ij + w_jk) / w_ik - 1.0;
Geometric pruning is performed on all edges with rel_dev < pruning_thld}

\item{compute.full}{Logical scalar. If TRUE, computes additional graph components and metrics.
If FALSE, computes only essential components. Default value: FALSE.}

\item{pca.dim}{Maximum number of principal components to use if dimensionality reduction
is applied (default: 100). Set to NULL to skip dimensionality reduction.}

\item{variance.explained}{Percentage of variance to be explained by the principal components
(default: 0.99). If this threshold can be met with fewer components than pca.dim,
the smaller number will be used. Set to NULL to use exactly pca.dim components.}

\item{verbose}{Logical. If TRUE, print progress messages. Default is TRUE.}
}
\value{
An object of class "IkNN" (inheriting from "list") containing:
\describe{
\item{pruned_adj_list}{Adjacency lists after pruning (1-based indices)}
\item{pruned_weight_list}{Distances for edges in pruned graph}
\item{n_edges}{Total number of edges in original graph}
\item{n_edges_in_pruned_graph}{Number of edges after pruning}
\item{n_removed_edges}{Number of edges removed by pruning}
\item{edge_reduction_ratio}{Proportion of edges removed}
\item{call}{The matched function call}
\item{k}{Number of nearest neighbors used}
\item{n}{Number of data points}
\item{d}{Number of features}
}

If compute.full = TRUE, additional components include:
\describe{
\item{adj_list}{Original adjacency lists (1-based indices)}
\item{isize_list}{Intersection sizes for original edges}
\item{weight_list}{Distances for original edges}
\item{conn_comps}{Connected components identification}
\item{connected_components}{Alternative format of connected components}
}
}
\description{
Creates and prunes an intersection-weighted k-nearest neighbors (IWD-kNN) graph from
input data. The graph is constructed based on feature space distances and intersection
sizes between neighbor sets.
