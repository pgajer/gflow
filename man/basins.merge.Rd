\title{Merge Two Basins in a Gradient Flow Complex}
\usage{
basins.merge(flow, absorbing.label, absorbed.label)
}
\arguments{
\item{flow}{An object of class \code{"ggflow"} returned by
\code{\link{construct.graph.gradient.flow}}.}

\item{absorbing.label}{Character string specifying the label of the basin that
will absorb the other basin.}

\item{absorbed.label}{Character string specifying the label of the basin that
will be absorbed.}
}
\value{
A modified gradient flow object with merged basins and updated cells.
}
\description{
Merges two basins in a gradient flow complex by having one basin absorb another.
The function updates the basin vertices, recomputes the cells based on the
new basin configuration, and updates the local extrema table.
}
\details{
The function identifies the type of basins (ascending or descending) from the
label prefixes: "m" for minima (ascending basins) and "M" for maxima
(descending basins). The absorbing basin incorporates all vertices from the
absorbed basin, and the gradient flow structure is updated accordingly.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Merge descending basins M2 and M3, with M2 absorbing M3
merged_flow <- basins.merge(flow, "M2", "M3")

# Check the updated structure
summary(merged_flow)
}
