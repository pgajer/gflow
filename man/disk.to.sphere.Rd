\title{Maps points from the interior of a unit disk onto the unit sphere of the same dimension as the disk}
\usage{
disk.to.sphere(X)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{A matrix or data frame specifying a set of points within the unit disk, where each
row represents a point and each column represents a dimension. All points must have
L2 norm strictly less than 1.}
}
\value{
A numeric matrix with nrow(X) rows and ncol(X)+1 columns, where each row represents
a point on the unit sphere in (n+1)-dimensional space. The returned points all have
L2 norm equal to 1.
}
\description{
This function transforms points from the interior of an n-dimensional unit disk (points with
L2 norm < 1) onto the surface of an (n+1)-dimensional unit sphere using a stereographic-like
projection. Points at the center of the disk map to the "north pole" of the sphere.
}
\details{
The mapping uses the following transformation:
\itemize{
\item For a point p with radius \eqn{r = ||p||}, the angle \eqn{\phi = \pi r}
\item The sphere coordinates are: \eqn{(\sin(\phi) p/r, \cos(\phi))}
\item Points at the origin (r = 0) map to (0, 0, ..., 0, 1)
}
}
\examples{
# Example 1: Map 2D disk points to 3D sphere
X <- matrix(c(0.5, 0.3, -0.2, 0.4, 0, 0), nrow = 3, ncol = 2, byrow = TRUE)
sphere_points <- disk.to.sphere(X)
# Verify all points are on unit sphere
apply(sphere_points, 1, function(x) sqrt(sum(x^2)))

# Example 2: Center point maps to north pole
origin <- matrix(c(0, 0), nrow = 1)
disk.to.sphere(origin)  # Returns (0, 0, 1)
}
