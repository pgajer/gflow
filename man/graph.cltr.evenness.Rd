\title{Compute local cluster evenness with full cluster support}
\usage{
graph.cltr.evenness(adj.list, cltr)
}
\arguments{
\item{adj.list}{List of adjacency vectors (1-based indices) for each vertex.}

\item{cltr}{A vector of cluster labels (factor, character, or numeric), one per vertex.}
}
\value{
Numeric vector of evenness values for each vertex.
}
\description{
Computes the evenness (normalized entropy) of cluster label distribution
in the expanded neighborhood of each vertex. The entropy is computed using
the full set of cluster labels, including those not present in the neighborhood
(i.e., with zero frequency), to ensure comparability across vertices.
