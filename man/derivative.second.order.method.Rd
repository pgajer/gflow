\title{Second-order accurate method of derivative of a function estimate}
\usage{
derivative.second.order.method(y, dx)
}
\arguments{
\item{y}{A numeric vector of response values defined over a uniform grid.}

\item{dx}{The distance between consecutive points of the grid over which y is defined.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of the same length as y containing the derivative estimates.
}
\description{
Computes the derivative using the second-order accurate finite difference method:
\deqn{f'(t_i) \approx \frac{-f(t_{i+2}) + 8f(t_{i+1}) - 8f(t_{i-1}) + f(t_{i-2})}{12\Delta t}}
}
\details{
It is assumed that y is defined over a uniform grid. The method uses:
\itemize{
\item Forward difference for the first point
\item Central difference for the second and second-to-last points
\item Backward difference for the last point
\item Five-point stencil for interior points
}

# Example with a quadratic function
x <- seq(0, 2*pi, length.out = 100)
y <- sin(x)
dx <- x[2] - x[1]
dy <- derivative.second.order.method(y, dx)

# Compare with analytical derivative
