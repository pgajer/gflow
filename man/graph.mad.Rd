\title{Calculate Median Absolute Deviation for Graph Vertices}
\usage{
graph.mad(graph, y)
}
\arguments{
\item{graph}{A list where each element is a numeric vector containing the indices
of neighboring vertices. The indices should be positive integers representing
1-based vertex numbering (as is standard in R).}

\item{y}{A numeric vector containing the values associated with each vertex.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of the same length as \code{y}, where each element is
the MAD value for the corresponding vertex. For vertices with no neighbors,
the MAD value will be 0.
}
\description{
Computes the Median Absolute Deviation (MAD) for each vertex in a graph based on its
neighborhood values. The MAD is calculated using the values of each vertex and its
immediate neighbors in the graph.
}
\details{
For each vertex, the function:
\itemize{
\item Considers the vertex's value and the values of its immediate neighbors
\item Calculates the median of these values
\item Computes the absolute deviations from this median
\item Returns the median of these absolute deviations
}
}
\note{
\itemize{
\item The graph structure should represent an undirected graph
\item Vertex indices in the graph list should be valid (between 1 and length(y))
\item Isolated vertices (those with no neighbors) will have a MAD value of 0
}
}
\examples{
# Create a simple chain graph with 3 vertices
g <- list(c(2), c(1,3), c(2))
values <- c(1, 10, 2)
graph.mad(g, values)

}
