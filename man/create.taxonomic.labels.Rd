\title{Create Taxonomic Labels for Vertices}
\usage{
create.taxonomic.labels(vertices, state.space, taxonomy, min.relAb.thld = 0.05)
}
\arguments{
\item{vertices}{A numeric vector of vertex indices to be labeled.}

\item{state.space}{A matrix or data frame containing the state space data,
where rows correspond to different states/samples.}

\item{taxonomy}{A data structure containing taxonomic information used by the
prof.fn function to generate taxonomic profiles.}

\item{min.relAb.thld}{Numeric value (default: 0.05). Minimum relative abundance
threshold. Taxa with abundance below this threshold will not be included
in the label.}
}
\value{
A list with two components:
\item{labels}{A named character vector containing the generated labels, with
names corresponding to vertex indices.}
\item{profiles}{A list of data frames containing the taxonomic profiles for
each vertex.}
}
\description{
Creates unique shortcut labels for vertices based on their taxonomic profiles.
The function generates two-letter shortcuts from species names and combines them
to create concise labels that represent the most abundant taxa in each vertex.
}
\details{
The function first creates taxonomic profiles for each vertex using the external
prof.fn function. It then generates labels based on the most abundant taxa above
the specified threshold. If multiple vertices get the same label, the function
ensures uniqueness by adding additional taxa information. The labels consist of
two-letter shortcuts for each taxon name, created by taking the first letter of
the first two parts of the underscore-separated name.
}
\note{
This function requires an external prof.fn function that is not defined here.
The prof.fn function should take an ID, state.space, and taxonomy as arguments and
return a data frame with taxa names in the first column and their abundances in
the second column.
