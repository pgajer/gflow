\item{subj.sVisit}{Numeric vector of subject visits.}
\item{E.pred.D}{Predicted risk value interpolated along the geodesic path.}
\item{E.D2}{Risk value at the second visit.}

\description{
Estimates subject risk of a disease or adverse outcome, D, given the risk D over some state space
}
\details{
This function calculates disease risk for a specific subject by:
\enumerate{
\item Finding the subject's visit states in the state space
\item Computing geodesic paths between consecutive visits
\item Interpolating risk values along these paths
\item Extracting maximum risk values and predicted risks
}

The function assumes the subject has at least 3 visits and uses geodesic paths
to model the subject's trajectory through the state space between visits.
