\title{Compute Standardized Effect Sizes with Bayesian Inference}
\usage{
compute.bayesian.effects(bb.integrals, reference_idx = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{bb.integrals}{List of Bayesian bootstrap integral values, where each element
contains bootstrap samples for a method. The list must be named with method
identifiers.}

\item{reference_idx}{Index of the reference method in the list (default: 1)}
}
\value{
A data frame where each row represents a method (named by method identifiers)
and columns contain:
\itemize{
\item mean_effect: Mean standardized effect size
\item median_effect: Median standardized effect size
\item ci_lower: Lower bound of 95\% credible interval
\item ci_upper: Upper bound of 95\% credible interval
\item hdi_lower: Lower bound of 95\% highest density interval
\item hdi_upper: Upper bound of 95\% highest density interval
\item prob_smaller: Probability of smaller effect than reference
\item prob_larger: Probability of larger effect than reference
\item prob_practical_equiv: Probability of practical equivalence
}
}
\description{
Computes standardized effect sizes and associated Bayesian statistics for comparing
multiple methods against a reference method. The standardization is performed using
the standard deviation of the reference method. The function provides point estimates
(mean and median effects), interval estimates (credible intervals and highest density
intervals), and posterior probabilities for different hypotheses.
}
\details{
The function computes several Bayesian statistics:
\itemize{
\item Effect sizes are standardized by dividing differences by the reference method's SD
\item 95\% credible intervals show the central 95\% of the effect size distribution
\item 95\% HDI (Highest Density Interval) shows the most probable 95\% of effect sizes
\item Posterior probabilities are computed for:
\itemize{
\item Method having smaller effect than reference (prob_smaller)
\item Method having larger effect than reference (prob_larger)
\item Effect being practically equivalent to reference (within Â±0.1 SD)
}
}
