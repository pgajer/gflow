\title{Compute a Mutual k-Nearest Neighbor Graph with Weights}
\usage{
create.mknn.graph(X, k)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{A numeric matrix or data frame where each row represents a data point
and each column represents a feature/dimension.}

\item{k}{A positive integer specifying the number of nearest neighbors to
consider. Must be at least 2.}
}
\value{
A list with class "mknn_graph" containing:
\describe{
\item{adj_list}{A list where element i contains the indices of vertices
connected to vertex i by an edge.}
\item{weight_list}{A list where element i contains the distances between
vertex i and its connected neighbors (in the same order as \code{adj_list[[i]]}).}
\item{n_vertices}{The number of vertices in the graph.}
\item{n_edges}{The total number of edges in the graph.}
\item{k}{The k value used to construct the graph.}
}
}
\description{
Creates an undirected graph where two points are connected by an edge if and
only if they are present in each other's k-nearest neighbor (kNN) lists.
The weight of each edge represents the distance between the connected vertices.
}
\details{
The mutual k-nearest neighbor graph is a symmetric graph where an edge between
vertices i and j exists if and only if:
\itemize{
\item j is among the k nearest neighbors of i, AND
\item i is among the k nearest neighbors of j
}

This mutual relationship ensures that the resulting graph is undirected and
typically sparser than a standard k-nearest neighbor graph.

\examples{
\dontrun{
# Generate sample 2D data
set.seed(123)
X <- matrix(rnorm(100 * 2), ncol = 2)

# Create mutual 5-NN graph
graph <- create.mknn.graph(X, k = 5)

# Print basic statistics
cat("Number of vertices:", graph$n_vertices, "\n")
cat("Number of edges:", graph$n_edges, "\n")

# Examine connections for first vertex
cat("Vertex 1 is connected to:", graph$adj_list[[1]], "\n")
cat("With distances:", round(graph$weight_list[[1]], 3), "\n")
}
