\arguments{
\item{adj.list}{List of integer vectors. Each vector contains indices of vertices
adjacent to the corresponding vertex. Indices should be 1-based.}

\item{weight.list}{List of numeric vectors. Each vector contains weights of edges
corresponding to adjacencies in adj.list.}

\item{grid.vertex}{Integer. The grid vertex to analyze.}

\item{min.radius}{Numeric. Minimum radius as a fraction of graph diameter.}

\item{max.radius}{Numeric. Maximum radius as a fraction of graph diameter.}

\item{n.steps}{Integer. Number of radius steps to test.}

\item{n.packing.vertices}{Integer. Number of vertices in the grid/packing.}
}
\value{
A data frame of class "vertex_geodesic_stats" with columns:
\describe{
\item{radius}{Actual radius used.}
\item{rays}{Number of geodesic rays within radius.}
\item{composite_geodesics}{Number of composite geodesics.}
\item{overlap_min}{Minimum overlap ratio.}
\item{overlap_p05}{5th percentile overlap ratio.}
\item{overlap_p25}{25th percentile overlap ratio.}
\item{overlap_median}{Median overlap ratio.}
\item{overlap_p75}{75th percentile overlap ratio.}
\item{overlap_p95}{95th percentile overlap ratio.}
\item{overlap_max}{Maximum overlap ratio.}
}
}
\description{
Analyzes how the number of geodesics scales with radius for a specific grid vertex.
