\arguments{
\item{n.BB}{The number of Bayesian bootstrap iterations}

\item{nn.i}{A matrix of indices of X of the nearest neighbors of each point of X.}

\item{nn.x}{A matrix of x values over K nearest neighbors of each element of the grid, where K is determined in the parent routine.}

\item{nn.y}{A matrix of y values over K nearest neighbors of each element of the grid.}

\item{nn.w}{A matrix of NN weights.}

\item{nx}{The number of elements of x.}

\item{max.K}{A vector of \strong{indices} indicating the range where weights are not 0.}

\item{degree}{The degree of the local models.}

\item{grid.nn.i}{A matrix of grid associated NN indices.}

\item{grid.nn.x}{A matrix of grid associated x values over NNs.}

\item{grid.nn.w}{A matrix of grid associated NN weights.}

\item{grid.max.K}{A vector of grid associated max.K values.}

\item{y.binary}{A logical variable. If TRUE, bw optimization is going to use a binary loss function mean(y(1-p) + (1-y)p).}

\item{alpha}{The confidence level.}
