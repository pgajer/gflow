\title{Display Profile of Top Components}
\usage{
show.profile(i, Z, n.comp = 5)
}
\arguments{
\item{i}{Integer. The row index at which to extract the profile.}

\item{Z}{Matrix. A matrix of values (e.g., biomarker abundances) where
rows represent samples and columns represent features.}

\item{n.comp}{Integer. The number of top components to include in the
profile (default: 5).}
}
\value{
A named numeric vector containing the top \code{n.comp} features
sorted by their mean values in descending order.
}
\description{
Shows a profile of the columns with the largest mean values from a
selected row of a matrix, typically used for analyzing biomarker abundances.
}
\details{
This function extracts a single row from the input matrix and
returns the features with the highest mean values. If the extracted
row is a vector, it's converted to a single-row matrix for consistent
processing.
}
\examples{
# Create example data
set.seed(123)
Z <- matrix(rnorm(100, mean = 10, sd = 2), nrow = 10, ncol = 10)
colnames(Z) <- paste0("Feature", 1:10)

# Get profile for row 1
profile <- show.profile(1, Z, n.comp = 3)
print(profile)
