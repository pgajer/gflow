\title{Estimate Mean Absolute Bias (MAB) of Smooth Spline Model}
\usage{
get.smooth.spline.MAB(x, y, xt, yt, folds)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A numeric vector representing the predictor variable for the training set.}

\item{y}{A numeric vector representing the response variable for the training set.}

\item{xt}{A numeric vector representing the predictor variable for the test set.}

\item{yt}{A numeric vector representing the response variable for the test set.}

\item{folds}{A list of indices for cross-validation folds}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\describe{
\item{MAB}{Mean Absolute Bias calculated on the test set}
\item{RMSE}{Root Mean Square Error}
\item{predictions}{Predictions made by the smooth spline model on the test set}
\item{residuals}{Absolute residuals}
\item{parameters}{List containing the optimal degrees of freedom}
}
}
\description{
Fits a smooth spline model to a given dataset and evaluates its performance using
cross-validation. The mean absolute error (MAE) is used as the performance metric.
The function selects the optimal degrees of freedom for the spline model based on MAE.
}
\details{
The function internally performs cross-validation to select the optimal
degrees of freedom (between 3 and 5) that minimizes the MAE. It then fits a
smooth spline model with the optimal degrees of freedom to the entire dataset
and evaluates its performance on the test set.
