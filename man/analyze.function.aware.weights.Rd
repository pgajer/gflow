\usage{
analyze.function.aware.weights(
  adj.list,
  weight.list,
  function.values,
  weight.types = 0:5,
  epsilon = 1e-06,
  lambda = 1,
  alpha = 1,
  beta = 5,
  tau = 0.1,
  p = 2,
  q = 2,
  r = 2
)
}
\arguments{
\item{adj.list}{A list where each element contains the indices of vertices adjacent to vertex i.
The list should be 1-indexed (as is standard in R).}

\item{weight.list}{A list of the same structure as adj.list, where each element contains the
weights of edges connecting vertex i to its adjacent vertices.}

\item{function.values}{A numeric vector containing function values at each vertex of the graph.}

\item{weight.types}{A vector of weight.type values to analyze (see construct.function.aware.graph
for details on weight types)}

\item{epsilon}{Small constant to avoid division by zero (for weight.type 0)}

\item{lambda}{Decay rate parameter (for weight.type 2)}

\item{alpha}{Power law exponent (for weight.type 3) or scaling factor (for weight.type 5)}

\item{beta}{Sigmoid steepness parameter (for weight.type 4)}

\item{tau}{Sigmoid threshold parameter (for weight.type 4)}

\item{p}{Power for feature distance term (for weight.type 5)}

\item{q}{Power for function difference term (for weight.type 5)}

\item{r}{Power for the overall normalization (for weight.type 5)}
}
\value{
A list where each element corresponds to a weight.type and contains a vector of
modified weights for all edges in the graph
}
\description{
Analyzes how different weighting schemes would modify edge weights based on function values.
