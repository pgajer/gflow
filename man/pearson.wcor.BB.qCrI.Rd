\title{Bayesian Bootstrap Credible Intervals for Pearson Weighted Correlation Coefficients}
\usage{
pearson.wcor.BB.qCrI(nn.y1, nn.y2, nn.i, nn.w, nx, n.BB = 1000, alpha = 0.05)
}
\arguments{
\item{nn.y1}{A matrix of y1 values corresponding to nearest neighbors.
Dimensions: \code{ng} x \code{K}, where \code{ng} is the number of groups
and \code{K} is the number of nearest neighbors.}

\item{nn.y2}{A matrix of y2 values corresponding to nearest neighbors.
Same dimensions as \code{nn.y1}.}

\item{nn.i}{A matrix of nearest neighbor indices (1-based indexing).
Same dimensions as \code{nn.y1}.}

\item{nn.w}{A matrix of nearest neighbor weights. Same dimensions as \code{nn.y1}.}

\item{nx}{The number of elements of x over which y1 and y2 are defined.}

\item{n.BB}{The number of Bayesian bootstrap iterations. Default is 1000.}

\item{alpha}{The significance level for credible intervals. Default is 0.05.}
}
\value{
A 2 x \code{ng} matrix where the first row contains the lower bounds
and the second row contains the upper bounds of the
\code{(1-alpha)*100\%} credible intervals for each group.
}
\description{
Computes Bayesian bootstrap credible interval estimates of Pearson weighted
correlation coefficients for nearest neighbor data.
}
\details{
This internal function uses Bayesian bootstrap to compute credible intervals
for weighted correlation coefficients in a nearest neighbor context. The function
calls C code for computational efficiency. Note that the C function expects
0-based indexing, so the R indices are adjusted by subtracting 1.
