\title{Pearson Weighted Correlation Coefficient}
\usage{
pearson.wcor(x, y, w)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A numeric vector.}

\item{y}{A numeric vector of the same length as \code{x}.}

\item{w}{A numeric vector of non-negative weights of the same length as \code{x}.}
}
\value{
A single numeric value representing the weighted Pearson correlation coefficient.
}
\description{
Computes the Pearson correlation coefficient between two numeric vectors with weights.
}
\details{
This function computes the weighted Pearson correlation coefficient using C code
for efficiency. The weights must be non-negative and the three vectors must have
the same length.
}
\examples{
x <- rnorm(100)
y <- rnorm(100)
w <- runif(100)
pearson.wcor(x, y, w)
