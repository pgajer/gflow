\title{Compute Energy Distance Between Two Datasets}
\usage{
energy.distance(X, Y)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{A matrix or data frame representing the first dataset.}

\item{Y}{A matrix or data frame representing the second dataset.}
}
\value{
A numeric value representing the energy distance between X and Y.
}
\description{
This function calculates the energy distance between two datasets. The energy distance
is a statistical distance between the distributions of random vectors, which is zero
if and only if the distributions are identical.

Intuitively, the energy distance can be thought of as a measure of the "tension" between
two distributions. If we imagine the points in each distribution as particles with the
same charge, the energy distance is analogous to the potential energy of the system.
When the distributions are identical, the "tension" or "energy" is minimized.

The energy distance has several desirable properties:
\enumerate{
\item It's simple to compute, requiring only pairwise distances between points.
\item It's applicable to data of any dimension.
\item It doesn't require density estimation, making it suitable for high-dimensional data.
}

While not a direct proxy for relative entropy, the energy distance provides a robust
measure of distributional differences and can be used in similar contexts.
