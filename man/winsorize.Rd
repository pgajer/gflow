\title{Winsorize a numeric vector}
\usage{
winsorize(x, p = 0.01)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A numeric vector to be winsorized}

\item{p}{The proportion of data to be winsorized on each tail (default is 0.01).
Must be between 0 and 0.25.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of the same length as \code{x} with extreme values replaced.
NA values in the input are preserved in the output.
}
\description{
Replaces extreme values in a numeric vector with less extreme values.
Values below the p-th percentile are set to the p-th percentile,
and values above the (1-p)-th percentile are set to the (1-p)-th percentile.
}
\examples{
# Simple example
x <- 1:10
winsorize(x, p = 0.2)

# With normally distributed data
set.seed(123)
y <- rnorm(100)
y_wins <- winsorize(y, p = 0.05)

# Compare ranges
range(y)
range(y_wins)
