\title{Simple 3D Point Selection}
\usage{
simple.pts3d.select(X)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{Numeric matrix with 3 columns representing x, y, z coordinates
of points in 3D space.}
}
\value{
Integer vector containing the indices of selected points.
}
\description{
Provides a simplified interface for selecting points in 3D space without
visual feedback during selection.
}
\details{
This function provides a minimal interface for point selection
in 3D space. Unlike \code{pts3d.select}, it doesn't provide visual
feedback during selection. It assumes the points in \code{X} correspond
to vertices in the current rgl scene.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
library(rgl)
# Create example 3D data
X <- matrix(rnorm(300), ncol = 3)

# Plot points
plot3d(X, col = "blue")

# Select points
selected_indices <- simple.pts3d.select(X)

# Highlight selected points
points3d(X[selected_indices, ], col = "red", size = 10)
}
