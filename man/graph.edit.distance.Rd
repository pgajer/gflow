\title{Calculate Graph Edit Distance (Pure R Implementation)}
\usage{
graph.edit.distance(
  graph1.adj.list,
  graph1.weights,
  graph2.adj.list,
  graph2.weights,
  edge.cost = 1,
  weight.cost.factor = 0.1
)
}
\arguments{
\item{graph1.adj.list}{A list of integer vectors representing the adjacency
list of the first graph. Each element contains the neighbors of the
corresponding vertex.}

\item{graph1.weights}{A list of numeric vectors representing the edge weights
of the first graph. Must have the same structure as \code{graph1.adj.list}.}

\item{graph2.adj.list}{A list of integer vectors representing the adjacency
list of the second graph.}

\item{graph2.weights}{A list of numeric vectors representing the edge weights
of the second graph.}

\item{edge.cost}{A positive numeric scalar representing the cost of adding or
removing an edge (default: 1).}

\item{weight.cost.factor}{A non-negative numeric scalar representing the
factor to scale weight differences (default: 0.1).}
}
\value{
A non-negative numeric value representing the graph edit distance
between the two input graphs.
}
\description{
Computes the graph edit distance between two weighted graphs with identical
vertex sets using a pure R implementation. This function considers edge
insertions, deletions, and weight modifications.
}
\details{
The graph edit distance is calculated as:
\itemize{
\item For edges present in one graph but not the other: \code{edge.cost}
\item For edges present in both graphs with different weights:
\code{abs(weight1 - weight2) * weight.cost.factor}
}

Both graphs must have the same number of vertices. The function assumes
undirected graphs.

\examples{
# Create two simple graphs
graph1.adj <- list(c(2, 3), c(1, 3), c(1, 2))
graph1.wts <- list(c(1, 2), c(1, 3), c(2, 3))

graph2.adj <- list(c(2, 3), c(1, 3), c(1, 2))
graph2.wts <- list(c(1.5, 2), c(1.5, 2.5), c(2, 2.5))

# Calculate distance
dist <- graph.edit.distance(graph1.adj, graph1.wts,
                           graph2.adj, graph2.wts)
print(dist)  # Weight differences only
