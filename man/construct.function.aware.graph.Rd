construct.function.aware.graph(
  adj.list,
  weight.list,
  function.values,
  weight.type = 0,
  epsilon = 1e-06,
  lambda = 1,
  alpha = 1,

}
\arguments{
\item{adj.list}{A list where each element contains the indices of vertices adjacent to vertex i.
The list should be 1-indexed (as is standard in R).}

\item{weight.list}{A list of the same structure as adj.list, where each element contains the
weights of edges connecting vertex i to its adjacent vertices.}

\item{function.values}{A numeric vector containing function values at each vertex of the graph.}

\item{weight.type}{Type of weight modification:
0: Inverse relationship: w_new = w_old / (|f(i) - f(j)| + epsilon)
1: Direct relationship: w_new = w_old * |f(i) - f(j)|
2: Exponential decay: w_new = w_old * exp(-lambda * |f(i) - f(j)|)
3: Power law: w_new = w_old * |f(i) - f(j)|^(-alpha)
4: Sigmoid: w_new = w_old * 1/(1 + exp(beta * (|f(i) - f(j)| - tau)))
5: L_p embedding: w_new = (w_old^p + alpha*|f(i) - f(j)|^q)^(1/r)}

\item{epsilon}{Small constant to avoid division by zero (for weight.type 0)}

\item{lambda}{Decay rate parameter (for weight.type 2)}

\item{alpha}{Power law exponent (for weight.type 3) or scaling factor (for weight.type 5)}

\item{beta}{Sigmoid steepness parameter (for weight.type 4)}

\item{tau}{Sigmoid threshold parameter (for weight.type 4)}

\item{p}{Power for feature distance term (for weight.type 5)}

\item{q}{Power for function difference term (for weight.type 5)}

\item{r}{Power for the overall normalization (for weight.type 5)}

\item{normalize}{Whether to normalize weights after modification}

\item{weight.thld}{Threshold for pruning edges; edges with weight > weight.thld will be pruned.
Set to a negative value to disable pruning.}
}
\value{
A new graph object with modified weights
