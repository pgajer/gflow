\title{Generate Random Partition of an Integer}
\usage{
generate.partition(n, a, m)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{A positive integer to be partitioned}

\item{a}{The number of parts in the partition}

\item{m}{The minimum value for each part}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of length a containing the partition, where each element
is greater than or equal to m and the sum equals n. Returns NULL if the
partition is impossible (when n < a * m).
}
\description{
This function generates a random partition of an integer n into a fixed number
of parts (a), where each part is at least m. It uses a sampling-based approach
to generate the partition.
}
\details{
The algorithm works by first calculating r = n - (a * m), then randomly sampling
(a-1) indices from 1 to r to create partition points. The differences between
consecutive partition points (plus m) become the values in the final partition.
}
\examples{
generate.partition(20, 4, 3)  # Generates a partition of 20 into 4 parts, each >= 3
generate.partition(10, 3, 2)  # Generates a partition of 10 into 3 parts, each >= 2
