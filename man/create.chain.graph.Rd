\title{Create a Chain Graph Structure}
\usage{
create.chain.graph(n.vertices = NULL, x = NULL, y = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{n.vertices}{Integer specifying the number of vertices. Required if x is NULL.}

\item{x}{Optional numeric vector. If provided, vertices will be ordered based on
these values, and n.vertices will be set to length(x).}

\item{y}{Optional numeric vector corresponding to x values. Must be the same
length as x if provided.}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\describe{
\item{adj.list}{List of adjacent vertices for each vertex}
\item{edge.lengths}{List of edge lengths between adjacent vertices (1 if x
not provided, otherwise based on x-coordinate differences)}
\item{x.sorted}{Sorted x values if x was provided, otherwise NULL}
\item{y.sorted}{y values sorted according to x order if both provided,
otherwise NULL}
}
}
\description{
Generates a chain graph where each vertex is connected to its immediate neighbors,
forming a linear chain structure. The graph can be constructed based on either
the number of vertices or a set of ordered x-coordinates.
}
\examples{
# Create a simple 4-vertex chain
chain1 <- create.chain.graph(4)
}
