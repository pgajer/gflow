\title{Function to calculate the Euclidean distance between two points}
\usage{
euclidean.distance(p1, p2)
}
\arguments{
\item{p1}{First point.}

\item{p2}{Second point.}
}
\value{
A numeric value representing the Euclidean distance between p1 and p2.
}
\description{
Function to calculate the Euclidean distance between two points
}
\details{
This function computes the Euclidean distance between two points in
n-dimensional space using the formula: \eqn{\sqrt(\sum((p1 - p2)^2))}.
The points \eqn{p1} and \eqn{p2} should be numeric vectors of the same
length.
}
\examples{
# Distance between two 2D points
point1 <- c(0, 0)
point2 <- c(3, 4)
euclidean.distance(point1, point2)  # Returns 5

# Distance between two 3D points
point1 <- c(1, 2, 3)
point2 <- c(4, 6, 8)
euclidean.distance(point1, point2)  # Returns sqrt(50)
