\title{Calculate Total Associations from Geodesic Analysis}
\usage{
total.associations(obj, ED = NULL, verbose = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{obj}{A list result from E.geodesic.X() containing at least:
\describe{
\item{X}{A matrix of data}
\item{data.dir}{Directory containing saved results}
}}

\item{ED}{Numeric vector of mean disease/outcome values over the geodesic.
If NULL (default), calculates associations with distance along geodesic.}

\item{verbose}{Logical indicating whether to print progress messages.
Default is FALSE.}
}
\value{
A matrix with columns:
\describe{
\item{TA}{Total Association}
\item{TAA}{Total Absolute Association}
\item{pval}{p-value for the association test}
}
Row names correspond to column names of the input matrix X.
}
\description{
Calculates total associations (TAs) and total absolute associations (TAAs)
between the distance along a geodesic and some function over the geodesic.
}
\details{
This function processes results from geodesic analysis, calculating associations
between variables along the geodesic path. When ED is NULL, it calculates
associations with the distance along the geodesic. When ED is provided,
it calculates associations with the specified outcome variable.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Assuming obj is a result from E.geodesic.X()
# Calculate associations with distance
ta_results <- total.associations(obj)

# Calculate associations with an outcome
ED <- rnorm(400)  # Example outcome vector
ta_results_ED <- total.associations(obj, ED = ED)
}
