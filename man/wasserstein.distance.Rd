\title{Compute Wasserstein Distance Between Two Datasets}
\usage{
wasserstein.distance(X, Y)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{A matrix or data frame representing the first dataset.}

\item{Y}{A matrix or data frame representing the second dataset.}
}
\value{
A numeric value representing the Wasserstein distance between X and Y.
}
\description{
This function calculates the Wasserstein distance (also known as Earth Mover's Distance)
between two datasets. The Wasserstein distance can be intuitively understood as the minimum
"cost" of transforming one distribution into another, where cost is measured as the amount
of probability mass that needs to be moved, multiplied by the distance it needs to be moved.

Imagine each distribution as a pile of earth, and the Wasserstein distance as the minimum
amount of work required to transform one pile into the other. This makes it particularly
useful for comparing distributions with different supports or when KL-divergence might be
undefined or infinite.

The algorithm uses the transport package to compute the distance efficiently. It's worth
noting that while this isn't a direct proxy for relative entropy, it provides a robust
measure of dissimilarity between distributions.
