\title{Show Basin Details from a Basin Complex}
\usage{
\method{show.basin}{basin_cx}(x, basin.label, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A basin complex object returned by create.basin.cx().}

\item{basin.label}{Character string specifying the basin label to retrieve (e.g., "M1" or "m2").}

\item{...}{Additional arguments (not used).}
}
\value{
A basin list corresponding to the requested label. If no basin with the specified
label is found, the function returns NULL and prints a message.
}
\description{
Retrieves and returns a specific basin from a basin complex object by its label.
The function searches through both ascending (minima) and descending (maxima) basins.
}
\details{
Basin labels follow the naming convention of the basin complex: "Mx" for maxima (descending)
and "mx" for minima (ascending), where x is a sequential number assigned during the basin
complex construction.

The returned basin list typically contains:
\itemize{
\item vertex: 1-based index of the extremum vertex
\item value: Function value at the extremum
\item label: The basin label matching the requested label
\item basin: Matrix with vertex indices and distances from the extremum
\item basin_bd: Matrix of boundary vertices and their monotonicity spans
}
}
