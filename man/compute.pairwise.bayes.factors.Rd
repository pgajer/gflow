\title{Compute Pairwise Bayes Factors for Method Comparisons}
\usage{
compute.pairwise.bayes.factors(bb.integrals)
}
\arguments{
\item{bb.integrals}{A named list of Bayesian bootstrap integral values, where each element
contains numeric samples representing the performance metric for a method. Names of the
list elements will be used as row and column names in the output matrix.}
}
\value{
A square matrix of Bayes factors where \code{BF[i,j]} represents the evidence for
method i being better than method j. Values > 1 indicate evidence for method i, values < 1
indicate evidence for method j. The diagonal contains 1s (method compared to itself).
}
\description{
Computes pairwise Bayes factors comparing all methods using Savage-Dickey density ratios.
Each Bayes factor represents evidence for one method versus another.
}
\details{
The function uses the Savage-Dickey density ratio to compute Bayes factors:
\itemize{
\item For each pair of methods, it computes the difference in their performance samples
\item Estimates the posterior density of these differences using kernel density estimation
\item Computes the prior density at 0 assuming a normal distribution
\item The Bayes factor is the ratio: posterior density at 0 / prior density at 0
\item When density estimation fails, uses extreme values (1000 or 0.001) based on mean difference
}
}
\note{
\itemize{
\item Uses Sheather-Jones bandwidth selection for robust density estimation
\item Interpretation: BF > 10 (strong evidence), BF > 3 (moderate evidence), BF > 1 (weak evidence)
\item The function assumes that higher values in bb.integrals indicate better performance
}

\examples{
# Example: Compare three methods
set.seed(123)
bb.integrals <- list(
  method_A = rnorm(1000, mean = 0.5, sd = 0.1),
  method_B = rnorm(1000, mean = 0.52, sd = 0.1),
  method_C = rnorm(1000, mean = 0.48, sd = 0.1)
)

bf_matrix <- compute.pairwise.bayes.factors(bb.integrals)
print(bf_matrix)

# Interpret results
# bf_matrix[1,2] > 1 suggests evidence for method_A over method_B
# bf_matrix[2,3] > 1 suggests evidence for method_B over method_C
