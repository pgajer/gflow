\arguments{
\item{x}{A graphMScx object containing the results of Morse-Smale complex
construction, as returned by \code{graph.MS.cx}}

\item{type}{Character string specifying the type of plot to generate:
\describe{
\item{\code{"MS_cx_graph"}}{Plot the Morse-Smale complex graph with vertices
colored by type (local minimum/maximum) using a bipartite layout}
\item{\code{"MS_cx_nerve_graph"}}{Plot the Cech (nerve) graph of the
Morse-Smale complex with edges weighted by the number of shared vertices
between cells}
\item{\code{"lmin_BoA"}}{Plot the graph with vertices colored by their
local minima branches of attraction}
\item{\code{"lmax_BoA"}}{Plot the graph with vertices colored by their
local maxima branches of attraction}
\item{\code{"MS_graphs"}}{Plot a specific Morse-Smale cell subgraph
(specify cell with parameter \code{i})}
\item{\code{"MS_cell"}}{Plot the entire graph highlighting a specific cell
with vertices colored by function values}
\item{\code{"Ey"}}{Plot the entire graph with vertices colored by function
values (Ey)}
}}

\item{i}{Integer specifying the index of the Morse-Smale cell to plot when
\code{type = "MS_graphs"} or \code{type = "MS_cell"}. Default is 1.}

\item{vertex.size}{Numeric scalar or vector specifying vertex sizes. For local
extrema, this is scaled by \code{lext.sfactor}. Default is 2.}

\item{vertex.label}{Character vector of vertex labels. If NULL (default),
labels are determined based on \code{show.only.lextr.labels}.}

\item{show.only.lextr.labels}{Logical. If TRUE (default), only show labels
for local extrema vertices.}

\item{edge.label.cex}{Numeric scalar controlling the size of edge labels in
the Morse-Smale complex graph. Default is 2.}

\item{legend.cex}{Numeric scalar controlling legend text size. Default is 1.}

\item{lmin.color}{Color for local minima vertices. Default is "blue".}

\item{lmax.color}{Color for local maxima vertices. Default is "red".}

\item{label.dist}{Numeric scalar controlling the distance of vertex labels
from vertices. Default is 1.5.}

\item{legend.position}{Character string specifying legend position. Options
include "topleft", "topright", "bottomleft", "bottomright". Default is "topleft".}

\item{lext.sfactor}{Numeric scalar for scaling the size of local extrema
vertices relative to regular vertices. Default is 5.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to plotting functions}
}
\value{
Invisible NULL. The function is called for its side effect of creating a plot.
}
\description{
Visualizes various aspects of a Morse-Smale complex computed on a graph, including
the complex itself, cell graphs, branches of attraction, and the original graph
with cell assignments. The graphMScx object is typically created by the
\code{graph.MS.cx} function.
}
\details{
The function provides multiple visualization options for understanding the
structure of the Morse-Smale complex:
\itemize{
\item The complex graph shows connections between critical points
\item Branch visualizations show which extrema influence each vertex
\item Cell visualizations show the decomposition of the graph
}

Local minima are displayed as downward-pointing triangles (blue by default),
while local maxima are shown as upward-pointing triangles (red by default).
}
\note{
This function requires the igraph package for graph visualization. The input
object must be properly formatted with all required components from the
Morse-Smale complex computation.

# Create a simple graph
adj_list <- list(c(2, 3), c(1, 3, 4), c(1, 2, 4), c(2, 3))

# Define function values on vertices

# Compute Morse-Smale complex
mscx <- graph.MS.cx(g, Ey)

# Plot the Morse-Smale complex graph
plot(mscx)

# Show branches of attraction for local minima
plot(mscx, type = "lmin_BoA")

# Plot a specific cell
plot(mscx, type = "MS_graphs", i = 2)

# Show the entire graph with first cell highlighted
plot(mscx, type = "MS_cell", i = 1)
