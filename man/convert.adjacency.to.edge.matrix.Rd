\title{Convert Adjacency List to Edge Matrix}
\usage{
convert.adjacency.to.edge.matrix(adj.list, weights.list = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{adj.list}{A list where each element is a vector of integers representing
the nodes adjacent to the node indexed by the element's position.}

\item{weights.list}{An optional list of numeric vectors representing the weights
of the edges. If provided, each element should correspond to the weights of
the edges in the same position in adj.list.}
}
\value{
A list with two elements:
\item{edge.matrix}{A matrix where each row represents an edge, given as a pair of node indices.}
\item{weights}{A numeric vector of weights corresponding to the edges in edge.matrix.
This is NULL if weights.list was not provided.}
}
\description{
This function converts an adjacency list representation of a graph to an edge matrix.
It can handle both weighted and unweighted graphs.
}
\details{
The function converts the input adjacency list to 0-based indexing before
passing it to the C++ function. The returned edge matrix uses 1-based indexing.
For undirected graphs, each edge is included only once, with the lower index always
appearing first.

\examples{
adj.list <- list(c(2,3), c(1,3), c(1,2))
result <- convert.adjacency.to.edge.matrix(adj.list)

# With weights
weights.list <- list(c(0.1, 0.2), c(0.1, 0.3), c(0.2, 0.3))
result_weighted <- convert.adjacency.to.edge.matrix(adj.list, weights.list)
