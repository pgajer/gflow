\arguments{
\item{adj.list}{A list where each element contains the indices of vertices adjacent to vertex i.}

\item{weight.list}{A list of the same structure as adj.list, with edge weights.}

\item{function.values}{Vector of function values at each vertex}

\item{weight.types}{Vector of weight types to analyze (default: 0:5)}

\item{epsilon}{Small constant to avoid division by zero (for weight.type 0)}

\item{lambda}{Decay rate parameter (for weight.type 2)}

\item{alpha}{Power law exponent (for weight.type 3) or scaling factor (for weight.type 5)}

\item{beta}{Sigmoid steepness parameter (for weight.type 4)}

\item{tau}{Sigmoid threshold parameter (for weight.type 4)}

\item{p}{Power for feature distance term (for weight.type 5)}

\item{q}{Power for function difference term (for weight.type 5)}

\item{r}{Power for the overall normalization (for weight.type 5)}

\item{log.scale}{Whether to use log scale for the y-axis}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns the data frame used for plotting
}
\description{
Creates a visualization comparing how different weighting schemes
modify edge weights based on function value differences.
