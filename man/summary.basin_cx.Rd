\description{
Generates a comprehensive summary of a gradient flow basin complex, including
detailed information about extrema, basins, basin overlaps, and cell complex
structure.
}
\details{
The summary method computes several key statistics and relationships:

\strong{Extrema Analysis:} Counts and details of all local minima and maxima
in the original function.

\strong{Basin Statistics:} For both ascending (minimum) and descending (maximum)
basins, provides counts, size distributions, and detailed information including
the representative vertex, label, size (number of vertices), and function value.

\strong{Basin Overlap:} Computes Jaccard indices between all pairs of basins
of the same type. The Jaccard index measures the overlap between two basins
as the ratio of their intersection size to their union size, ranging from 0
(no overlap) to 1 (complete overlap).

\strong{Cell Complex:} Summarizes the structure of cells representing
intersections between basins.
