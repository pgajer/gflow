\title{Calculate Jaccard index between two sets represented as numeric vectors}
\usage{
jaccard.index(vec.1, vec.2)
}
\arguments{
\item{vec.1}{A numeric vector representing the first set. Duplicate values are
automatically removed to form a proper set.}

\item{vec.2}{A numeric vector representing the second set. Duplicate values are
automatically removed to form a proper set.}
}
\value{
A numeric value between 0 and 1 representing the Jaccard index, where:
\itemize{
\item 0 indicates no overlap between the sets
\item 1 indicates the sets are identical
\item Values between 0 and 1 indicate partial overlap
}
Returns NaN if both sets are empty (0/0 case).
}
\description{
The Jaccard index (also known as Jaccard similarity coefficient) is defined as the ratio
of the size of the intersection of the two sets to the size of their union. Formally:
\deqn{J(A, B) = \frac{|A \cap B|}{|A \cup B|}}{J(A, B) = |A  intersect  B| / |A  union  B|}
The index ranges from 0 (no overlap) to 1 (identical sets).
}
\details{
The function first converts the input vectors to sets by removing duplicates
using \code{unique()}, then computes the intersection and union using R's built-in
set operations. This ensures that the calculation follows proper set theory principles
where each element is counted only once.
}
\note{
\itemize{
\item The function treats the inputs as sets, so duplicate values are ignored
\item For comparing multisets (where duplicates matter), consider other similarity measures
\item The Jaccard distance can be computed as 1 - Jaccard index
\item NA values in the input vectors are preserved and treated as distinct elements
}

\examples{
# Example 1: Basic usage with duplicates
samples.1 <- c(1, 2, 5, 5)
samples.2 <- c(2, 2, 5, 7)
jaccard.index(samples.1, samples.2)  # Returns 0.5 (intersection: {2,5}, union: {1,2,5,7})

# Example 2: Identical sets
jaccard.index(c(1, 2, 3), c(3, 2, 1))  # Returns 1

# Example 3: No overlap
jaccard.index(c(1, 2, 3), c(4, 5, 6))  # Returns 0

# Example 4: One empty set
jaccard.index(c(1, 2, 3), numeric(0))  # Returns 0

# Example 5: Comparing sample indices or cluster memberships
cluster1_samples <- c(1, 3, 5, 7, 9)
cluster2_samples <- c(2, 4, 5, 7, 8)
similarity <- jaccard.index(cluster1_samples, cluster2_samples)
print(paste("Cluster overlap:", round(similarity * 100, 1), "\%"))
