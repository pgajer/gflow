### Files Copied from msr2 to gflow:
The following files were copied from `/Users/pgajer/current_projects/msr2/R/` to `/Users/pgajer/current_projects/gflow/R/`:
- `graph_generators.R` - contains `generate.star.dataset` and related functions
- `divergences.R` - contains `jensen.shannon.divergence`
- `random_sampling.R` - contains `runif.sphere`, `runif.torus`
- `synthetic_data_utils.R` - contains `generate.circle.data`
- `stats_utils.R` - contains statistical utility functions

## 2. Current State of gflow R Package

### Package Status:
- **Version**: 0.1.0
- **License**: GPL (>= 3)
- **Current Check Results**: 1 ERROR, 3 WARNINGs, 5 NOTEs

### Major Issues Remaining:

#### ERROR:
- Examples still failing (needs investigation of new example failures)

#### WARNINGs:
1. Header files (.hpp) in src directory (informational, not critical)
2. Eigen library warnings (expected, from third-party library)
3. Missing package dependencies:
   - `HDInterval`, `MASS`, `transport` (need to be added to Imports)
   - `Matrix` (needs proper declaration)
   - `rstan` (should use :: or requireNamespace())

#### NOTEs:
1. S3 method registration issues for newly added functions
2. Many undefined global functions (need imports)
3. Missing documentation for some functions

## 3. Shell Commands Attempted

### Successful Commands:
None directly executed due to shell snapshot corruption

### Failed Commands (due to shell error):
```bash
# All commands failed with: parse error near `()' at line 183
which R
pwd
ls -la /Users/pgajer/current_projects/
echo $PATH
rm -f fix_eigen_eval.sh fix_eigen_simple.sh
cp /Users/pgajer/current_projects/msr2/R/graph_generators.R /Users/pgajer/current_projects/gflow/R/
```

### Shell Issue:
- File `/Users/pgajer/.claude/shell-snapshots/snapshot-zsh-1756487429552-20gds0.sh` has a malformed function definition at line 183
- The `repeat()` function definition is missing proper syntax

### Manual Commands Required:
```bash
cd ~/current_projects/gflow
find src -name "*.o" -delete; find src -name "*.so" -delete
cd ~/current_projects
R CMD build gflow
rm -f gflow_check_results.txt
R CMD check gflow_0.1.0.tar.gz --as-cran > gflow_check_results.txt 2>&1
```

## 4. R Functions Worked On

### Fixed/Modified:
- `compare.adj.lists` → `compare_adj_lists`
- `plot.colored.graph` → `plot_colored_graph`
- `compute.graph.diameter` (fixed typo in example)
- `get.edge.weights` (added chunk declaration)
- `compute.np.from.dists` (fixed typo)
- `convert.adjacency.to.edge.matrix` (fixed .Call usage)

### Functions Added (via file copying):
- `generate.star.dataset`
- `jensen.shannon.divergence`
- `runif.sphere`
- `runif.torus`
- `generate.circle.data`
- Various functions in stats_utils.R

## 5. Pending Tasks

### Immediate Tasks:
1. Add missing package dependencies to DESCRIPTION:
   - `HDInterval`
   - `MASS`
   - `transport`
   - `Matrix`
   - `glmnet` (for cv.glmnet)
   - `rootSolve` (for uniroot.all)
   - `rstan` (move to Suggests)

2. Update NAMESPACE with proper imports for:
   - All functions listed in the undefined globals
   - Methods from newly added packages

3. Register S3 methods properly for:
   - `plot.gaussian.mixture`
   - `plot.gaussian.mixture.3d`
   - `plot.gaussian.mixture.surface`
   - `plot.star_object`
   - Other methods flagged in check

4. Fix or remove undefined functions:
   - `create.iknn.graph` (possibly should be `create.single.iknn.graph`)
   - `compute.degree.js.divergence`
   - `compute.edit_distancesy` (likely typo)
   - Various other missing functions

5. Remove non-standard top-level files:
   - `fix_eigen_eval.sh`
   - `fix_eigen_simple.sh`

### Long-term Tasks:
1. Add documentation for all newly added functions
2. Add unit tests for critical functions
3. Clean up debug code and commented sections
4. Optimize performance-critical C++ code
5. Consider whether all copied functions are necessary

## 6. Shell Copy Command Issue

The specific copy command that was failing:
```bash
cp /Users/pgajer/current_projects/msr2/R/graph_generators.R /Users/pgajer/current_projects/gflow/R/
```

This command failed due to the shell snapshot corruption issue. The files were ultimately copied successfully (likely manually by the user), as evidenced by their presence in the gflow/R directory.

## Notes

The session focused on preparing the gflow package for CRAN submission by:
1. Fixing compilation warnings and errors
2. Correcting R code issues
3. Adding missing dependencies
4. Copying necessary functions from the msr2 package

The main blocker for further automated fixes was the corrupted shell snapshot file, which prevented execution of bash commands. Manual intervention was required for file operations and R CMD check execution.

## Next Steps

1. Fix the shell snapshot issue or create a new shell session
2. Add all missing package dependencies to DESCRIPTION
3. Update NAMESPACE with comprehensive imports
4. Register all S3 methods properly
5. Run R CMD check again to verify fixes
6. Address any remaining issues systematically
