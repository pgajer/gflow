#' Cluster Local Extrema Based on Basin Overlap
#'
#' @description
#' Identifies clusters of local extrema (either maxima or minima) whose basins
#' of attraction exhibit substantial overlap or containment relationships. The
#' function uses basin labels from \code{\link{summary.basins_of_attraction}}
#' to ensure consistency with other analyses and returns both numeric cluster
#' assignments and a convenient cluster membership list.
#'
#' @details
#' The clustering problem arises naturally in Morse-Smale analysis when multiple
#' local extrema are positioned close together in the function landscape, creating
#' basins that either overlap substantially or exhibit containment relationships
#' where a smaller basin lies entirely within a larger one. Traditional similarity
#' measures like the Jaccard index may fail to detect such containment patterns
#' because they normalize by the union size rather than the smaller set size.
#'
#' We address this by employing the overlap coefficient, also known as the
#' Szymkiewicz-Simpson index, which measures basin similarity through the ratio
#' of intersection size to the minimum basin size. For two basins $A$ and $B$,
#' the overlap coefficient is defined as
#' $$
#' \text{OC}(A,B) = \frac{|A \cap B|}{\min(|A|, |B|)}
#' $$
#' This measure equals one when either basin is completely contained in the other,
#' making it ideal for detecting nested or highly overlapping basin structures.
#'
#' The overlap distance, given by $d(A,B) = 1 - \text{OC}(A,B)$, converts this
#' similarity into a proper metric. We construct a threshold graph where basins
#' are connected by edges whenever their overlap distance falls below the
#' specified threshold. Connected components of this graph define clusters of
#' similar basins. Within each cluster, basins likely represent the same or
#' closely related features in the underlying function landscape.
#'
#' The function internally calls \code{\link{summary.basins_of_attraction}} to
#' obtain consistent basin labels. These labels follow the convention that minima
#' are labeled m1, m2, ... in order of increasing function value (so m1 is the
#' global minimum), while maxima are labeled M1, M2, ... in order of decreasing
#' function value (so M1 is the global maximum). This labeling scheme ensures
#' that clustering results align with other basin analyses.
#'
#' The function operates exclusively on basins of a single extremum type to
#' maintain the interpretability of clusters. Mixing ascending and descending
#' basins would conflate fundamentally different topological features.
#'
#' The overlap graph returned by the function can be visualized using standard
#' graph visualization tools to examine the structure of basin relationships.
#'
#' @param basins.obj An object of class \code{"basins_of_attraction"} returned by
#'   \code{\link{compute.basins.of.attraction}}. This object contains the
#'   complete basin structure for both local minima and local maxima.
#' @param adj.list Adjacency list of the graph.
#' @param edgelen.list A list of numeric vectors containing edge lengths.
#'   Element \code{i} contains the lengths of edges incident to vertex \code{i}.
#'   Must have length equal to the number of vertices in the graph. This parameter
#'   is passed to \code{\link{summary.basins_of_attraction}} to generate
#'   consistent basin labels and compute basin characteristics.
#' @param extrema.type Character string specifying which type of extrema to
#'   cluster. Must be either \code{"max"} for local maxima (descending basins)
#'   or \code{"min"} for local minima (ascending basins). Default is \code{"max"}.
#' @param overlap.threshold Numeric value in the interval \eqn{[0, 1]} specifying the
#'   threshold for the overlap distance below which basins are considered similar
#'   and connected in the clustering graph. Smaller values produce more conservative
#'   clustering with tighter similarity requirements. For example, a threshold of
#'   0.15 requires that basins share at least 85% overlap relative to the smaller
#'   basin. Default is 0.1, corresponding to 90% overlap.

#'       for maxima or \code{m1}, \code{m2}, ... for minima) and values are cluster
#'       identifiers. Basins with the same cluster identifier belong to the same
#'       cluster.}
#'     \item{clusters}{Named list where names are cluster identifiers (as character
#'       strings) and values are character vectors of basin labels belonging to each

#'       Vertex names in the adjacency list match basin labels.}
