Package: gflow
Title: Gradient Flow Data Analysis Framework
Version: 0.1.0

    person("Pawel", "Gajer", , "pgajer@gmail.com", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: Provides tools and methods for gradient flow-based data analysis.
    The package implements algorithms for adaptive k-nearest neighbor graph 
    construction, graph-based smoothing, piecewise linear modeling with optimal
    breakpoint detection, and gradient flow computation on high-dimensional data.
    These methods facilitate exploratory data analysis, manifold learning, and
    the study of data structure through geometric and spectral graph techniques.
