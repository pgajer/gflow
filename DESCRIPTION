Description: The gflow package implements geometric methods for analyzing
    high-dimensional data by exploiting the fact that most real-world
    high-dimensional datasets are highly structured and sparse, displaying an
    intrinsic dimension often orders of magnitude smaller than the number of
    features (the dimension of the ambient space in which the data is embedded). The
    package provides tools for modeling the intrinsic geometric structures of data
    and estimating conditional expectations of response variables over these
    geometric objects. Inferential analysis is performed using the Morse-Smale
    regression approach, which decomposes the domain (the geometric object
    associated with the data) into gradient flow cells. Within each cell, the
    regression model exhibits an essentially monotonic structure that can be
    analyzed using classical statistical methods.
