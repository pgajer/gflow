/**
 * @brief A structure containing path data for composite paths constructed from
 * the shortest paths starting at a __grid vertex__ of a graph
 *
 * If there is only one shortest path starting at the given grid vertex (of
 * length bound by the bandwidth parameter) the path itself will be a degenerate
 * composite path. If the set of shortest paths starting at the ref vertex has
 * more than one element, each pair of these paths is combined to form a
 * composite path. In most of the cases the reference vertex that is a graph
 * grid vertex will not be a part of the path as the path consist of only
 * original graph vertices over which the response variable is defined. Thus,
 * ref_vertex is a grid vertex index that may in rare cases be an original
 * vertex. The structure in a non-grid case had a parameter ref_vertex_index
 * that was removed from this structure as in most cases it will not make sense
 * (as the ref vertex is not part of the vertices vector).
 *
 * @details The structure maintains several key components:
 *   - The sequence of vertices in the path
 *   - Information about a reference vertex, including its position in both the
 *     original graph and within this path
 *   - Metrics about the path's structure and the reference vertex's position
 *   - Arrays of computed values along the path for analysis and visualization
